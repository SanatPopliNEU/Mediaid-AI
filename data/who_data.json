        "content": "Tetanus is an acute infectious disease caused by spores of the bacteriumClostridium tetani. The spores are found everywhere in the environment, particularly in soil, ash, intestinal tracts/feces of animals and humans, and on the surfaces of skin and rusty tools like nails, needles, barbed wire, etc. Being very resistant to heat and most antiseptics, the spores can survive for years.\nAnyone can get tetanus, but the disease is particularly common and serious in newborn babies and pregnant women who have not been sufficiently immunized with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines. Tetanus during pregnancy or within 6 weeks of the end of pregnancy is called maternal tetanus, and tetanus within the first 28 days of life is called neonatal tetanus.\nThe disease remains an important public health problem in many parts of the world, but especially in low-income countries or districts, where immunization coverage is low, and unclean birth practices are common. Neonatal tetanus occurs when nonsterile instruments are used to cut the umbilical cord or when contaminated material is used to cover the umbilical stump. Deliveries carried out by people with unclean hands or on a contaminated surface are also risk factors.\nIn 2018, approximately 25\u00a0000 newborns died from neonatal tetanus, a 97% reduction from 1988 when an estimated 787\u00a0000 newborn babies died of tetanus within their first month of life. However, there is increased risk of tetanus in adolescent and adult males who undergo circumcision due to waning immunity and limited opportunity for receiving booster doses in males in many countries."

The WHO definition of a confirmed neonatal tetanus case is an illness occurring in an infant who has the normal ability to suck and cry in the first 2 days of life, but who loses this ability between days 3 and 28 of life and becomes rigid or has spasms.\nThe WHO definition of non-neonatal tetanus requires at least one of the following signs: a sustained spasm of the facial muscles in which the person appears to be grinning, or painful muscular contractions. Although this definition requires a history of injury or wound, tetanus may also occur in patients who are unable to recall a specific wound or injury."

The 3-dose primary series should begin as early as 6 weeks of age, with subsequent doses given with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. The 3 booster doses should preferably be given during the second year of life (12\u201323 months), at 4\u20137 years of age, and at 9\u201315 years of age. Ideally, there should be at least 4 years between booster doses.\nThere are many kinds of vaccines used to protect against tetanus, all of which are combined with vaccines for other diseases:\ndiphtheria and tetanus (DT) vaccinesdiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) (DTaP) vaccinestetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccinestetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccines.\nNeonatal tetanus can be prevented by immunizing women of reproductive age with TTCV, either during pregnancy or outside of pregnancy. Additionally, robust medical practices can also prevent tetanus disease including clean delivery and cord care during childbirth, and proper wound care for surgical and dental procedures.\nIn countries where national programmes have maintained high immunization coverage for several decades, tetanus incidence rates are very low."

Aclear and simple definitionhas been developed to facilitate the coordination of future PHC efforts at the global, national and local levels and to guide their implementation: \"PHC is a whole-of-society approach to health that aims at ensuring the highest possible level of health and well-being and their equitable distribution by focusing on people\u2019s needs and as early as possible along the continuum from health promotion and disease prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care, and as close as feasible to people\u2019s everyday environment.\"\nPHC entails three inter-related and synergistic components, including: comprehensive integrated health services that embrace primary care as well as public health goods and functions as central pieces; multi-sectoral policies and actions to address the upstream and wider determinants of health; and engaging and empowering individuals, families and communities for increased social participation and enhanced self-care and self-reliance in health.\nPHC is rooted in a commitment to social justice, equity, solidarity and participation. It is based on the recognition that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction.\nFor universal health coverage (UHC) to be truly universal, a shift is needed from health systems designed around diseases and institutions towards health systems designed for people, with people. PHC requires governments at all levels to underscore the importance of action beyond the health sector in order to pursue a whole-of government approach to health, including health-in-all-policies, a strong focus on equity and interventions that encompass the entire life-course.\nPHC addresses the broader determinants of health and focuses on the comprehensive and interrelated aspects of physical, mental and social health and well-being. It provides whole-person care for health needs throughout the lifespan, not just for a set of specific diseases. Primary health care ensures people receive quality comprehensive care \u2013 ranging from promotion and prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care \u2013 as close as feasible to people\u2019s everyday environment."

UHC, the health-related SDGs and health security goals are ambitious but achievable. Progress must be urgently accelerated, and PHC provides the means to do so.\nPHC is the most inclusive, equitable, cost-effective and efficient approach to enhance people\u2019s physical and mental health, as well as social well-being. Evidence of wide-ranging impact of investment in PHC continues to grow around the world, particularly in times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAcross the world, investments in PHC improve equity and access, health-care performance, accountability of health systems, and health outcomes. While some of these factors are directly related to the health system and access to health services, the evidence is clear that a broad range of factors beyond health services play a critical role in shaping health and well-being. These include social protection, food systems, education and environmental factors, among others.\nPHC is also critical to make health systems more resilient to situations of crisis, more proactive in detecting early signs of epidemics and more prepared to act early in response to surges in demand for services.\u00a0 Although the evidence is still evolving there is widespread recognition that PHC is the so-called front door of the health system and provides the foundation for the strengthening of the essential public health functions to confront public health crises such as COVID-19."

The Strategy envisions zero leprosy: zero infection and disease, zero disability, zero stigma and discrimination. The four strategic pillars of the Strategy include: implementing integrated, country-owned zero leprosy roadmaps in all endemic countries; scaling up leprosy prevention alongside integrated active case detection; managing leprosy and its complications and prevent new disability; and combatting stigma and ensuring human rights are respected. The Strategy also recognizes the need for investment in research and includes a set of key research priorities.\nWHO has developed e-learning modules that aim to enhance knowledge and skills of health workers at all levels on topics related to diagnosis, treatment of leprosy and management of disabilities. These can be accessed through theWHO Academy."

Currently one of the biggest challenges is ensuring that products are available to those who need them and that they do not place added financial burden on individuals.\nAssessing and ensuring an enabling environment in which self-care interventions can be made available in safe and appropriate ways must be a key initial piece of any strategy to introduce or scale-up these interventions.

Testing of CSF sample is preferred to reduce false-positivity rates from previous infection or vaccination.\nSurveillance of the disease is mostly syndromic for acute encephalitis syndrome.

WHO recommends having strong JE prevention and control activities, including JE immunization in all regions where the disease is a recognized public health priority, along with strengthening surveillance and reporting mechanisms. Even if the number of JE-confirmed cases is low, vaccination should be considered where there is a suitable environment for JE virus transmission. Introduction of the vaccine should be done in conjunction with a one-time catch-up campaign.\nThere are three main types of JE vaccines currently in use: several inactivated Vero cell-derived vaccines, a live attenuated vaccine, and a live recombinant (chimeric) vaccine. One inactivated vaccine and the two live vaccines are WHO prequalified.\nThe risk to travellers to Japanese encephalitis-endemic areas is normally low, but travellers should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites. Personal preventive measures include the use of mosquito repellents, long-sleeved clothes, coils and vaporizers. Travellers spending extensive time in JE endemic areas are recommended to get vaccinated before travel.\nIn endemic areas, there is little evidence to support a reduction in JE disease burden from interventions other than the vaccination of humans. Thus, vaccination of humans should be prioritized over vaccination of pigs and mosquito control measures.

Additional years provide the chance to pursue new activities such as further education, a new career or a long-neglected passion.\r\n    Older people also contribute in many ways to their families and communities. Yet the extent of these opportunities and contributions depends heavily on one factor: health.\nEvidence suggests that the proportion of life in good health has remained broadly constant, implying that the additional years are in poor health. If people can experience these extra years of life in good health and if they live in a supportive environment,\r\n    their ability to do the things they value will be little different from that of a younger person. If these added years are dominated by declines in physical and mental capacity, the implications for older people and for society are more negative.\nAlthough some of the variations in older people\u2019s health are genetic, most is due to people\u2019s physical and social environments \u2013 including their homes, neighbourhoods, and communities, as well as their personal characteristics \u2013\r\n    such as their sex, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. The environments that people live in as children \u2013 or even as developing fetuses \u2013 combined with their personal characteristics, have long-term effects on how they age.\nPhysical and social environments can affect health directly or through barriers or incentives that affect opportunities, decisions and health behaviour. Maintaining healthy behaviours throughout life, particularly eating a balanced diet, engaging in regular\r\n    physical activity and refraining from tobacco use, all contribute to reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases, improving physical and mental capacity and delaying care dependency.\nSupportive physical and social environments also enable people to do what is important to them, despite losses in capacity. The availability of safe and accessible public buildings and transport, and places that are easy to walk around, are examples of\r\n    supportive environments. In developing a public-health response to ageing, it is important not just to consider individual and environmental approaches that ameliorate the losses associated with older age, but also those that may reinforce recovery,\r\n    adaptation and psychosocial growth."

In spite of recent national surveys in several low- and middle-income countries, data from many countries are still lacking.\nChild maltreatment is complex and difficult to study. Current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used. Estimates depend on:\nthe definitions of child maltreatment used;the type of child maltreatment studied;the coverage and quality of official statistics;the coverage and quality of surveys that request self-reports from victims, parents or caregivers.\nNonetheless, international studies reveal that 6 in 10 children under 5 years of age regularly suffer physical punishment and/or psychological violence at the hands of parents and caregivers, and 1 in 5 women and 1 in 7 men report having been sexually abused as a child.\nEvery year, there are an estimated 40 150 homicide deaths in children under 18 years of age, some of which are likely due to child maltreatment. This number almost certainly underestimates the true extent of the problem, since a significant proportion of deaths due to child maltreatment are incorrectly attributed to falls, burns, drowning and other causes.\nIn armed conflict and refugee settings, girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, exploitation and abuse by combatants, security forces, members of their communities, aid workers and others."

Proper collection, storage and transport of respiratory specimens is the essential first step for laboratory detection of influenza virus infections. Laboratory confirmation is commonly performed using direct antigen detection, virus isolation, or detection of influenza-specific RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Of these, 1.6 million deaths were from noncommunicable diseases, 700 000 deaths from injuries and 300\u00a0000 deaths from communicable diseases.The alcohol-attributable mortality was heaviest among men, accounting for 2 million deaths compared to 600 000 deaths among women, in 2019.An estimated 400 million people, or 7% of the world\u2019s population aged 15 years and older, lived with alcohol use disorders. Of this, 209 million people (3.7% of the adult world population) lived with alcohol dependence.Alcohol consumption, even at low levels can bring health risks, but most alcohol related harms come from heavy episodic or heavy continuous alcohol consumption.Effective alcohol control interventions exist and should be utilized more, at the same time it is important for people to know risks associated with alcohol consumption and take individual actions to protect from its harmful effects.OverviewAlcohol and alcoholic beverages contain ethanol, which is a psychoactive and toxic substance with dependence-producing properties. Alcohol has been widely used in many cultures for centuries, but it is associated with significant health risks and harms.Worldwide, 2.6 million deaths were attributable to alcohol consumption in 2019, of which 2 million were among men and 0.6 million among women. The highest levels of alcohol-related deaths per 100 000 persons are observed in the WHO European and African Regions with 52.9 deaths and 52.2 deaths per 100 000 people, respectively.People of younger age (20\u201339 years) are disproportionately affected by alcohol consumption with the highest proportion (13%) of alcohol-attributable deaths occurring within this age group in 2019.The data on global alcohol consumption in 2019 shows that an estimated 400 million people aged 15 years and older live with alcohol use disorders, and an estimated 209 million live with alcohol dependence.There has been some progress; from 2010 to 2019, the number of alcohol-attributable deaths per 100 000 people decreased by 20.2% globally.There has been a steady increase in the number of countries developing national alcohol policies. Almost all countries implement alcohol excise taxes. However, countries report continued interference from the alcohol industry in policy development.Based on 2019 data, about 54% out of 145 reporting countries had national guidelines/standards for specialized treatment services for alcohol use disorders, but only 46% of countries had legal regulations to protect the confidentiality of people in treatment.Access to screening, brief intervention and treatment for people with hazardous alcohol use and alcohol use disorder remains very low, as well as access to medications for treatment of alcohol use disorders. Overall, the proportion of people with alcohol use disorders in contact with treatment services varies from less than 1% to no more than 14% in all countries where such data are available.Health risks of alcohol useAlcohol consumption is found to play a causal role in more than 200 diseases, injuries and other health conditions. However, the global burden of disease and injuries caused by alcohol consumption can be quantified for only 31 health conditions on the basis of the available scientific evidence for the role of alcohol use in their development, occurrence and outcomes.Drinking alcohol is associated with risks of developing noncommunicable diseases such as liver diseases, heart diseases, and different types of cancers, as well as mental health and behavioural conditions such as depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorders.An estimated 474 000 deaths from cardiovascular diseases were caused by alcohol consumption in 2019.Alcohol is an established carcinogen and alcohol consumption increases the risk of several cancers, including breast, liver, head and neck, oesophageal and colorectal cancers. In 2019, 4.4% of cancers diagnosed globally and 401 000 cancer deaths were attributed to alcohol consumption.Alcohol consumption also causes significant harm to others, not just to the person consuming alcohol. A significant part of alcohol-attributable disease burden arises from injuries such as road traffic accidents. In 2019, of a total of 298 000 deaths from alcohol-related road crashes, 156 000 deaths were caused by someone else\u2019s drinking.Other injuries, intentional or unintentional, include falls, drowning, burns, sexual assault, intimate partner violence and suicide.A causal relationship has been established between alcohol use and the incidence or outcomes of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV.Alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the risk of having a child with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), the most severe form of which is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is associated with developmental disabilities and birth defects. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can also increase the risk of pre-term birth complications including miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery.Younger people are disproportionately negatively affected by alcohol consumption, with the highest proportion (13%) of alcohol-attributable deaths in 2019 occurring among people aged between 20 and 39 years.In the long term, harmful and hazardous levels of alcohol consumption can lead to social problems including family problems, issues at work, financial problems, and unemployment.Factors affecting alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harmThere is no form of alcohol consumption that is risk-free. Even low levels of alcohol consumption carry some risks and can cause harm.The level of risk depends on several factors, including the amount consumed, frequency of drinking, the health status of the individual, age, sex, and other personal characteristics, as well as the context in which alcohol consumption occurs.Some groups and individuals who are vulnerable or at risk may have a higher susceptibility to the toxic, psychoactive and dependence-inducing properties of alcohol. On the other hand, individuals who adopt lower-risk patterns of alcohol consumption may not necessarily face a significantly increased likelihood of negative health and social consequences.Societal factors which affect the levels and patterns of alcohol consumption and related problems include cultural and social norms, availability of alcohol, level of economic development, and implementation and enforcement of alcohol policies.The impact of alcohol consumption on chronic and acute health outcomes is largely determined by the total volume of alcohol consumed and the pattern of drinking, particularly those patterns which are associated with the frequency of drinking and episodes of heavy drinking. Most alcohol related harms come from heavy episodic or heavy continuous alcohol consumption.The context plays an important role in the occurrence of alcohol-related harm, particularly as a result of alcohol intoxication. Alcohol consumption can have an impact not only on the incidence of diseases, injuries and other health conditions, but also on their outcomes and how these evolve over time.There are gender differences in both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related mortality and morbidity. In 2019, 52% of men were current drinkers, while only 35% of women had been drinking alcohol in the last 12 months. Alcohol per capita consumption was, on average, 8.2 litres for men compared to 2.2 litres for women. In 2019, alcohol use was responsible for 6.7% of all deaths among men and 2.4% of all deaths among women.WHO responseThe Global alcohol action plan 2022\u20132030, endorsed by WHO Member States, aims to reduce the harmful use of alcohol through effective, evidence-based strategies at national, regional and global levels. The plan outlines six key areas for action: high-impact strategies and interventions, advocacy and awareness, partnership and coordination, technical support and capacity-building, knowledge production and information systems, and resource mobilization.Implementation of global strategy and action plan will accelerate global progress towards attaining alcohol-related targets under the Sustainable Development Goal 3.5 on strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol.Achieving this will require global, regional and national actions on the levels, patterns and contexts of alcohol consumption and the wider social determinants of health, with a particular focus on implementing high-impact cost effective interventions.It is vital to address the determinants that drive the acceptability, availability and affordability of alcohol consumption through cross-sectoral, comprehensive and integrated policy measures. It is also of critical importance to achieve universal health coverage for people living with alcohol use disorders and other health conditions due to alcohol use by strengthening health system responses and developing comprehensive and accessible systems of treatment and care that for those in need.The SAFER initiative, launched in 2018 by WHO and partners, supports countries to implement the high-impact, cost-effective interventions proven to reduce the harm caused by alcohol consumption.The WHO Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH) presents data on levels and patterns of alcohol consumption, alcohol-attributable health and social consequences and policy responses across the world.Achieving a reduction in the harmful use of alcohol in line with the targets included in the Global alcohol action plan, the SDG 2030 agenda and the WHO Global monitoring framework for noncommunicable diseases, requires concerted action by countries and effective global governance.Public policies and interventions to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm should be guided and formulated by public health interests and based on clear public health goals and the best available evidence.Engaging all relevant stakeholders is essential but the potential conflicts of interest, particularly with the alcohol industry, must be carefully assessed before engagement. Economic operators should refrain from activities that might prevent, delay or stop the development, enactment, implementation and enforcement of high-impact strategies and interventions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol.By working together, with due diligence and protection from conflicts of interest, the negative health and social consequences of alcohol can be effectively reduced."

Even low levels of alcohol consumption carry some risks and can cause harm.\nThe level of risk depends on several factors, including the amount consumed, frequency of drinking, the health status of the individual, age, sex, and other personal characteristics, as well as the context in which alcohol consumption occurs.\nSome groups and individuals who are vulnerable or at risk may have a higher susceptibility to the toxic, psychoactive and dependence-inducing properties of alcohol. On the other hand, individuals who adopt lower-risk patterns of alcohol consumption may not necessarily face a significantly increased likelihood of negative health and social consequences.\nSocietal factors which affect the levels and patterns of alcohol consumption and related problems include cultural and social norms, availability of alcohol, level of economic development, and implementation and enforcement of alcohol policies.\nThe impact of alcohol consumption on chronic and acute health outcomes is largely determined by the total volume of alcohol consumed and the pattern of drinking, particularly those patterns which are associated with the frequency of drinking and episodes of heavy drinking. Most alcohol related harms come from heavy episodic or heavy continuous alcohol consumption.\nThe context plays an important role in the occurrence of alcohol-related harm, particularly as a result of alcohol intoxication. Alcohol consumption can have an impact not only on the incidence of diseases, injuries and other health conditions, but also on their outcomes and how these evolve over time.\nThere are gender differences in both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related mortality and morbidity. In 2019, 52% of men were current drinkers, while only 35% of women had been drinking alcohol in the last 12 months. Alcohol per capita consumption was, on average, 8.2 litres for men compared to 2.2 litres for women. In 2019, alcohol use was responsible for 6.7% of all deaths among men and 2.4% of all deaths among women."

        "content": "The Global alcohol action plan 2022\u20132030, endorsed by WHO Member States, aims to reduce the harmful use of alcohol through effective, evidence-based strategies at national, regional and global levels. The plan outlines six key areas for action: high-impact strategies and interventions, advocacy and awareness, partnership and coordination, technical support and capacity-building, knowledge production and information systems, and resource mobilization.\nImplementation of global strategy and action plan will accelerate global progress towards attaining alcohol-related targets under the Sustainable Development Goal 3.5 on strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol.\nAchieving this will require global, regional and national actions on the levels, patterns and contexts of alcohol consumption and the wider social determinants of health, with a particular focus on implementing high-impact cost effective interventions.\nIt is vital to address the determinants that drive the acceptability, availability and affordability of alcohol consumption through cross-sectoral, comprehensive and integrated policy measures. It is also of critical importance to achieve universal health coverage for people living with alcohol use disorders and other health conditions due to alcohol use by strengthening health system responses and developing comprehensive and accessible systems of treatment and care that for those in need.\nThe SAFER initiative, launched in 2018 by WHO and partners, supports countries to implement the high-impact, cost-effective interventions proven to reduce the harm caused by alcohol consumption.\nThe WHO Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH) presents data on levels and patterns of alcohol consumption, alcohol-attributable health and social consequences and policy responses across the world.\nAchieving a reduction in the harmful use of alcohol in line with the targets included in the Global alcohol action plan, the SDG 2030 agenda and the WHO Global monitoring framework for noncommunicable diseases, requires concerted action by countries and effective global governance.\nPublic policies and interventions to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm should be guided and formulated by public health interests and based on clear public health goals and the best available evidence.\nEngaging all relevant stakeholders is essential but the potential conflicts of interest, particularly with the alcohol industry, must be carefully assessed before engagement. Economic operators should refrain from activities that might prevent, delay or stop the development, enactment, implementation and enforcement of high-impact strategies and interventions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol.\nBy working together, with due diligence and protection from conflicts of interest, the negative health and social consequences of alcohol can be effectively reduced."

In conflict or war, key health infrastructure or CBRN facilities can be deliberately damaged, contaminated or destroyed with widespread consequences. Geopolitical shifts and conflicts create new circumstances for DEs. In addition to these traditional agents, emerging threats include disinformation and the misuse of cyber and technology means, with direct or indirect consequences on human health (fear, mistrust, major psychological impacts, delay in access to care, etc.). Scientific advances and access to technological and digital tools have increased the potential risks of high-consequence DEs. Atomic science is known as a typical example of a so-called double-edged sword; something that has or can have both favourable and unfavourable consequences. For example, nuclear power can be used for sustainable and large-scale energy production or nuclear weapons of mass destruction. This is also true for health and life science research, which is sometimes known as dual-use research of concern (DURC). For example, while understanding key characteristics of microorganisms will help prevention and control of infectious diseases, application of gene editing and reconstruction science can lead to a new and disastrous pathogen. The public health, economic and national security consequences from DEs have made it necessary for governments to seek to prevent such use, to have the means of detecting such events and to prepare for and be ready to respond to them. These efforts should be developed as an integral part of existing national emergency and public health plans.\nUncertainty about exposure to a deliberately released agent is likely to increase fear, anxiety and panic amongst the general public.\u00a0Preparedness,\u00a0training and education, risk communication and debriefing aimed at mitigating psychological consequences are important to consider for ensuring the mental health of front-line workers and affected populations."

Currently, there are no global estimates on fragility fractures, and available data include all fractures combined. According to data from the Global Burden of Disease Study, the absolute incidence, prevalence and years lived with disability for fractures have significantly increased from 1990 to 2019, with highest age-specific incidence rates in the oldest age groups(1)in which most fractures are due to bone fragility (fragility fractures). These substantial increases have been associated with increased healthcare costs globally.\nIn the largest five countries of the European Union plus Sweden, the annual costs of fragility fractures are expected to increase by 27% by 2030(2). The same trend is reported in other parts of the world.

In fact, as with many age-related conditions, fragility fractures can result from multiple causes and risk factors.\nOsteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone density and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture.

However, there are many examples of the failure of this approach. There is often little transparency about the way many gambling products function. EGMs can mislead users with design features that encourage extended use. Existing health promotion messages are often inadequate and can use so-called dark nudges, which encourage the consumption of harmful products (for example, by exploiting gamblers' cognitive biases) and may enhance normalization.

Self-help, pharmacological interventions and mutual support have less evidence of efficacy, although the latter are among the most used interventions. Some evidence supports internet-based therapies, although attrition is a significant issue.\nTreatment for gambling disorder has a low rate of uptake, with an estimated 0.14% of the population seeking formal and informal help for current problems. Stigma and shame often prevent people from seeking help. The preferred regulatory approach of the gambling industry \u2013 so-called responsible gambling \u2013 adds to this burden by effectively blaming those who experience harm. Responsible gambling interventions are typically ineffective, particularly where the uptake of measures is optional.\nThose seeking to better control or cease gambling should be provided with tools to support them. These include universal pre-commitment (requiring people to set binding limits of time and money spent gambling) and self-exclusion (allowing people to ban themselves from gambling providers). Universal (also known as mandatory) systems are most effective. Voluntary systems have poor uptake and are non-enforceable. Prevention is the most cost-effective strategy for minimizing gambling-related harm."

Breast lumps that are cancerous are more likely to be successfully treated when they are small and have not spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nBreast cancers may spread to other areas of the body and trigger other symptoms. Often, the most common first detectable site of spread is to the lymph nodes under the arm although it is possible to have cancer-bearing lymph nodes that cannot be felt.\nOver time, cancerous cells may spread to other organs including the lungs, liver, brain and bones.

These include:\nsurgery to remove the breast tumourradiation therapy to reduce recurrence risk in the breast and surrounding tissuesmedications to kill cancer cells and prevent spread, including hormonal therapies, chemotherapy or targeted biological therapies.\nTreatments for breast cancer are more effective and are better tolerated when started early and taken to completion.\nSurgery may remove just the cancerous tissue (called a lumpectomy) or the whole breast (mastectomy). Surgery may also remove lymph nodes to assess the cancer\u2019s ability to spread.\nRadiation therapy treats residual microscopic cancers left behind in the breast tissue and/or lymph nodes and minimizes the chances of cancer recurring on the chest wall.\nAdvanced cancers can erode through the skin to cause open sores (ulceration) but are not necessarily painful. Women with breast wounds that do not heal should seek medical care to have a biopsy performed.\nMedicines to treat breast cancers are selected based on the biological properties of the cancer as determined by special tests (tumour marker determination).\u00a0 The great majority of drugs used for breast cancer are already on the WHO Essential Medicines List (EML).\nLymph nodes are removed at the time of cancer surgery for invasive cancers. Complete removal of the lymph node bed under the arm (complete axillary dissection) in the past was thought to be necessary to prevent the spread of cancer. A smaller lymph node procedure called \u201csentinel node biopsy\u201d is now preferred as it has fewer complications.\nMedical treatments for breast cancers, which may be given before (\u201cneoadjuvant\u201d) or after (\u201cadjuvant\u201d) surgery, is based on the biological subtyping of the cancers. Certain subtypes of breast cancer are more aggressive than others such as triple negative (those that do not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER-2 receptor). Cancer that express the estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) are likely to respond to endocrine (hormone) therapies such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors.\u00a0 These medicines are taken orally for 5\u201310 years and reduce the chance of recurrence of these \u201chormone-positive\u201d cancers by nearly half.\u00a0Endocrine therapies can cause symptoms of menopause but are generally well tolerated.\nCancers that do not express ER or PR are \u201chormone receptor negative\u201d and need to be treated with chemotherapy unless the cancer is very small. The chemotherapy regimens available today are very effective in reducing the chances of cancer spread or recurrence and are generally given as outpatient therapy. Chemotherapy for breast cancer generally does not require hospital admission in the absence of complications.\nBreast cancers that independently overexpress a molecule called the HER-2/neu oncogene (HER-2 positive) are amenable to treatment with targeted biological agents such as trastuzumab. When targeted biological therapies are given, they are combined with chemotherapy to make them effective at killing cancer cells.\nRadiotherapy plays a very important role in treating breast cancer. With early-stage breast cancers, radiation can prevent a woman having to undergo a mastectomy. With later stage cancers, radiotherapy can reduce cancer recurrence risk even when a mastectomy has been performed. For advanced stages of breast cancer, in some circumstances, radiation therapy may reduce the likelihood of dying of the disease.\nThe effectiveness of breast cancer therapies depends on the full course of treatment. Partial treatment is less likely to lead to a positive outcome."

They can be caused by either parasites, bacteria or viruses.Malaria is a parasitic infection transmitted byAnophelinemosquitoes. It causes an estimated 249 million cases globally, and results in more than 608 000 deaths every year. Most of the deaths occur in children under the age of 5 years.Dengue is the most prevalent viral infection transmitted byAedesmosquitoes. More than 3.9 billion people in over 132 countries are at risk of contracting dengue, with an estimated 96 million symptomatic cases and an estimated 40 000 deaths every year.Other viral diseases transmitted by vectors include chikungunya fever, Zika virus fever, yellow fever, West Nile fever, Japanese encephalitis (all transmitted by mosquitoes), tick-borne encephalitis (transmitted by ticks) and Oropouche fever (transmitted by Culicoides flies)Many of vector-borne diseases are preventable through protective measures and community mobilization."

        "content": "Vectors are living organisms that can transmit infectious pathogens between humans, or from animals to humans. Many of these vectors are bloodsucking insects which ingest disease-producing microorganisms during a blood meal from an infected host (human or animal) and later transmit it into a new host, after the pathogen has replicated. Often, once a vector becomes infectious, they are capable of transmitting the pathogen for the rest of their life during each subsequent bite/blood meal."

        "content": "Vector-borne diseases are human illnesses caused by parasites, viruses and bacteria that are transmitted by vectors. Every year there are more than 700 000 deaths from diseases such as malaria, dengue, schistosomiasis, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and onchocerciasis.\nThe burden of these diseases is highest in tropical and subtropical areas, and they disproportionately affect the poorest populations. Since 2014, major outbreaks of dengue, malaria, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika have afflicted populations, claimed lives, and overwhelmed health systems in many countries. Other diseases such as chikungunya, leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis cause chronic suffering, life-long morbidity, disability and occasional stigmatization.\nDistribution of vector-borne diseases is determined by a complex set of demographic, environmental and social factors. Global travel and trade, unplanned urbanization, climate change and silent spread and adaptation of the vectors have all contributed to the spread of vector-borne diseases.\nClimate change substantially affects pathogens (parasites, viruses and bacteria), vectors, and reservoir hosts, with implications for the transmission of many vector-borne diseases. Several vectors have expanded their latitude and altitude ranges, and the length of the season during which they are active is increasing. These trends are expected to continue as the climate continues to get warmer."

It provides strategic guidance to countries and development partners for urgently strengthening vector control as a fundamental approach to preventing disease and responding to outbreaks. To achieve this, a re-alignment of vector control programmes is required, supported by increased technical capacity, improved infrastructure, strengthened monitoring and surveillance systems, and greater community mobilization. Ultimately, this will support the implementation of a comprehensive approach to vector control that will enable the achievement of disease-specific national and global goals and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage.\nWHO Secretariat provides strategic, normative, and technical guidance to countries and development partners to strengthen vector control as a fundamental approach based on GVCR to prevent disease and respond to outbreaks. Specifically, WHO responds to vector-borne diseases by:\nproviding evidence-based guidance for controlling vectors and protecting people against infection;providing technical support to countries so that they can effectively manage cases and outbreaks;supporting countries to improve their reporting systems and capture the true burden of the disease;providing training (capacity building) on clinical management, diagnosis and vector control with support from some of its collaborating centres; andsupporting the development and evaluation of new tools, technologies and approaches for vector-borne diseases, including vector control and disease management technologies.\nA crucial element in reducing the burden of vector-borne diseases is behavioural change. WHO works with partners to provide education and improve public awareness, so that people know how to protect themselves and their communities from mosquitoes, ticks, bugs, flies and other vectors.\nAccess to water and sanitation is a very important factor in disease control and elimination. WHO works together with many different government sectors to improve water storage, sanitation, thereby helping to control these diseases at the community level."

Most global lead consumption is for the manufacture of lead-acid batteries for motor vehicles. Lead is used in many products, including pigments, paints, solder, stained glass, lead crystal glassware, ammunition, ceramic glazes, jewellery, toys, some traditional cosmetics, and some traditional medicines. Lead can contaminate drinking water through plumbing systems containing lead pipes, solders and fittings.\nYoung children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead and can suffer permanent adverse health impacts, particularly on the development of the central nervous system.

Moreover, children\u2019s innate curiosity and their age-appropriate and frequent hand-to-mouth and object-to-mouth behaviours increase their risk of exposure to lead-contaminated dust, soil and paint. Children who engage in pica, the compulsive, habitual consumption of non-food items, are at particularly high risk. Exposure to lead-contaminated soil and dust resulting from battery recycling and mining has caused outbreaks of mass lead poisoning, including deaths in young children, in some countries.\nOnce lead enters the body, it is distributed to organs including the brain, kidneys, liver and bones. Lead is stored in the teeth and bones, where it accumulates over time. Lead stored in bone may be released into the blood during pregnancy and expose the fetus. Malnourished children are more susceptible to lead as they absorb more lead if other nutrients are deficient, especially calcium or iron."

Chronic infections are associated with severe morbidity with symptoms reflecting the\r\n    organ in which the adult worms are located in.\nAcute infection withOpisthorchis sppandClonorchis sinensismay be asymptomatic in light infections but clinical symptoms such as fever, right upper-quadrant pain may be seen with high parasite burdens due to obstruction of the gallbladder\r\n    by the worm. Chronic infection fromO. viverriniandC. sinensisresulting from protracted episodes of re-infection over time may be most severe, with chronic inflammation resulting in fibrosis the ducts and destruction of the adjacent\r\n    liver parenchyma. These changes can result in cholangiocarcinoma, a severe bile duct cancer which is often fatal. For this reason, bothO. viverriniandC. sinensisare classified as carcinogens. Data on chronic infections withO. felineusis sparse, and this parasite is not classified as a carcinogen.\nFascioliasis consists of an asymptomatic incubation period following ingestion of the parasite which is then followed by an acute and a chronic clinical phase. The acute phase ofFasciolainfection begins when the immature worms penetrate the\r\n    intestinal wall and peritoneum then puncture the liver surface and travel to the bile ducts. This process results in destruction of liver cells and causes internal bleeding. Symptoms can include fever, nausea, swollen liver, skin rashes and severe\r\n    abdominal pain. The chronic phase begins when the worms reach the bile ducts, mature and start producing eggs. These eggs are released into the bile then reach the intestine before being evacuated in faeces. Symptoms can include intermittent pain,\r\n    jaundice, anaemia, pancreatitis and gallstones. Chronic infections result in liver cirrhosis due to long-term inflammation.\nEarly stages of paragonimiasis may be asymptomatic. Once worms reach the lungs symptoms can be significant and include a chronic cough with blood stained sputum, chest pain, dyspnoea, and fever, and can result in complications of pleural effusion and\r\n    pneumothorax. Symptoms and signs can be confounded with tuberculosis and should be considered in suspected tuberculosis patients that are not responding to treatment. Ectopic paragonimiasis is also common with cerebral paragonimiasis being most common.\r\n    Symptoms associated with this include headaches, visual impairment, epileptic seizures and cerebral haemorrhage."

Confirmation of the diagnosis relies on different diagnostic techniques.\nParasitological techniques to detect eggs in stool samples for clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis and fascioliasis, and direct sputum smear microscopy for paragonimiasis.

An integrated One Health approach which links animal, human and environmental aspects should be used.\u00a0 Interventions such as information, education\r\n    and communication on safe food practices, improved sanitation and veterinary public health measures should be implemented to decrease transmission rates and reduce risk of infection.\nTo control morbidity, WHO recommends improved access to treatment using safe and effective anthelmintic medicines\nTreatment of clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis relies on praziquantel, administered at a dose of 25mg/kg 3 times daily for 2-3 consecutive days or of a single administration at 40mg/kg.Fascioliasis should be treated with triclabendazole 10mg/kg administered as a single dose. Where treatment failure occurs, the dosage may be increased to 20mg/kg in two divided doses 12-24 hours apart.Paragonimiasis can be treated with triclabendazole 20mg/kg, in two divided doses of 10mg/kg to be administered on the same day, or praziquantel 25mg/kg 3 times a day for 3 days. Treatment with triclabendazole is preferred due to the simplicity of\r\n        its regiment and thus its higher compliances to treatment.\nFor the purposes of public health control, WHO recommends carrying out community diagnosis at the district level and implementing population-based preventive chemotherapy in areas where large number of people are infected. Individual case-management with\r\n    treatment of people with confirmed or suspected infection is appropriate where cases are less clustered and where health facilities are available.\nPreventive chemotherapy alone is insufficient to reduce prevalence. Factors such as poor sanitation and food hygiene, animal reservoirs and cultural eating habits contribute to high reinfection rates after treatment.

A One Health approach incorporating interventions in the veterinary\r\n    and agricultural sectors, improved sanitation and access to safe water, and communication about improved food safety and hygiene is vital to the control of foodborne trematode infections.\nWHO works closely with partner agencies such as the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to promote interdisciplinary collaboration. Tripartite joint meetings have been organized\r\n    to promote actions between sectors and jointly support countries in building their capacities for effective control of foodborne parasitic diseases, such as the meeting to accelerate prevention and control of neglected foodborne parasitic zoonoses\r\n    in Asian countries held in Lao PDR in 2018.\u00a0 Additionally, a series of communications and guidance publications targeting different sectors, namely public health practitioners, food safety authorities and veterinary practitioners have been produced\r\n    by the Tripartite in Asia.\nEffective intersectoral collaboration within the NTD network improves the quality and cost-effectiveness of interventions and minimises duplication of work. FBT infections are often co-endemic with many other diseases, particularly those affecting vulnerable\r\n    populations.\nWHO promotes the integration of FBT surveillance and interventions with WASH programmes and other WASH-related NTDs, and the joint delivery of preventive chemotherapy to affected populations alongside suitable food delivery or immunisation programmes.\r\n    Joint detection of paragonimiasis and tuberculosis can improve surveillance and ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment of cases."

Only one country detected DTG at a very low prevalence of 0.2%, which was attributed to a rare non-polymorphic integrase mutation. However, these surveys were conducted before DTG was introduced or during the early stages of transition in these countries and thus cannot provide evidence of an absence of DTG resistance in populations initiating or reinitiating ART as scale-up and maintenance on DTG-based ART continues.\nThe levels of pretreatment rilpivirine (RPV) resistance among individuals initiating ART without previous exposure to ARV drugs ranged from 0.0% (95% CI 0.0\u20139.4%) in Tajikistan in 2016 to a high of 16.6% (95% CI 11.2\u201324.0%) in Eswatini. These data suggest that if RPV were to be used in combination with cabotegravir as a long-acting ART, pretreatment HIV drug resistance testing would be needed in some settings to identify those without RPV drug resistance because pretreatment RPV drug resistance mutations are a risk factor for failure to suppress viral load among people treated with long-acting cabotegravir in combination with RPV.\nTo date, only one country has reported data from a survey of HIV drug resistance among infants after introducing DTG-containing regimens.

These products can be found in all countries, impacting all types of medical products, including life-saving treatments like vaccines, antibiotics and cancer therapies. In 2017, the World Health Organization estimated that 1 in 10 medicines in low- and middle-income countries failed quality control tests, suggesting the product is substandard or falsified. This can lead to serious health risks, treatment failures and even death.\nThe economic burden is also substantial, with billions of dollars lost annually due to ineffective treatments, increased healthcare costs and loss of productivity. For patients, the consequences are dire: relying on ineffective or harmful products can exacerbate illnesses, lead to prolonged suffering and contribute to drug resistance, making diseases harder to treat.\nThe issue of substandard and falsified medical products is pervasive and challenging to address due to sophisticated falsification techniques that are difficult to detect and insufficient national resources to respond effectively. This problem significantly undermines health systems, erodes trust in healthcare, and results in financial losses for both patients and legitimate industries.\nIncreasingly sophisticated networks manufacture these products, exploiting the demand for affordable medical treatments. The rise in online sales through unauthorized sites has further exacerbated the issue, allowing falsified products to reach consumers more easily. Tackling this problem necessitates robust legal frameworks, regional and international cooperation, heightened public awareness and stronger enforcement measures. These steps are crucial to safeguarding the integrity of health systems and ensuring the availability of safe and effective medical products for prevention, treatment and care.\nGlobal cooperation, robust regulations, legal frameworks and public awareness are essential to tackle the issue and ensure that all people have access to safe and effective medical products."

        "content": "Lassa fever is an acute viral illness caused by Lassa virus that was first identified in 1969 in Nigeria. The virus belongs to the virus familyArenaviridae.\nLassa fever is a zoonotic disease, meaning that humans become infected from contact with infected animals. The animal reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genusMastomys, commonly known as the multimammate rat.Mastomysrats infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces.\nAbout 80% of people who become infected with Lassa virus have no or mild symptoms. One in 5 infections result in severe disease, where the virus affects several organs such as the liver, spleen and kidneys.\nBecause the clinical course of the disease is very variable, detection of the disease in affected patients has been difficult. When presence of the disease is confirmed in a community, early detection and prompt isolation and care of patients, good infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings, and promoting community hygiene and rodent prevention, can prevent further spread of the disease."

They can be found living in and around homes, colonizing areas where food is stored and are able to live in fields or cleared forest. WhileMastomysrats serve as the main reservoir, Lassa virus has been also isolated from other rodent species, suggesting their potential role as additional source of infection.\nAlthough to a much less extent, Lassa virus may also spread between humans through direct contact with blood, urine, faeces or other bodily secretions of a person infected with Lassa fever. Person-to-person transmission may occur primarily in health-care settings, where the virus may also be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as re-used needles.\nHealth workers are at risk if caring for Lassa fever patients in the absence of appropriate infection prevention and control practices.\nLassa virus may persist in the semen of some males who recovered from the disease for up to few months. However, to date no transmission via exposure to infected semen had ever been documented.\nThere is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans."

        "content": "The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 2\u201321 days.\nWhen it is symptomatic, the onset of the disease is usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness headache and malaise. After a few days, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough and abdominal pain may follow. As the disease progresses, in severe cases facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure may develop. Shock, seizures, tremor, disorientation, and coma may be seen in the later stages. Among hospitalized patients, approximately 15% die of Lassa fever disease. In fatal cases, death usually occurs within 14 days of symptom onset.\nDuring pregnancy, Lassa fever can cause high maternal and foetal mortality, especially late in pregnancy. In the third trimester, fetal death and maternal death rates can exceed 80% and 30% respectively.\nRecovery can take a long time (prolonged convalescence) and sometimes leads to other conditions (sequelae). Sudden hearing loss has been reported with varying incidence and up to 25% of recovered patients, both during acute disease and after recovery. In most circumstances hearing loss is reported to be permanent. Other sequelae including neurological signs, visual impairment, joint pain, transient hair loss and psychological disorders have been reported to a lesser extent. Therefore, patients who have recovered from Lassa fever should receive care for sequelae they may experience."

These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, and safe injection practices. Healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient\u2019s blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Lassa virus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions.\nIn endemic areas, especially during the epidemic season, health workers should have a higher level of suspicion for Lassa fever in patients presenting with suggestive symptoms. Family members should always be careful to avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick persons. Patients suspected or confirmed for Lassa fever should be referred to a designated treatment center for early care.\nOn rare occasions, travellers returning from endemic areas were confirmed for Lassa fever. Although malaria, typhoid fever and many other tropical infections are much more common, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from west Africa, especially if they have had exposures in areas where Lassa fever is known to be endemic.

The initial lesion of yaws is teemed with the bacteria. Most lesions occur on the limbs. The incubation period is 9\u201390 days, with an average of 21 days. Without treatment, infection can lead to chronic disfigurement and disability.\nWHO classifies countries into three epidemiological groups.\nGroup A: countries with currently known endemic status\nGroup B: previously endemic countries, with unknown current status\nGroup C: are countries with no history of yaws.\nIn 2013, 13 countries were known to be endemic with yaws. Since then, and through intense surveillance activities, 2 additional countries reported confirmed cases (Liberia and Philippines)(1)and 3 countries reported suspected yaws cases (Colombia, Ecuador and Haiti).\nIn 2021, a single case of yaws was reported in a 5-year-old child from Malaysia, one of the countries listed by WHO as previously endemic but current status unknown (2). Further investigations are warranted.\nOut of the countries and territories known to have been endemic in the 1950s, at least 76 fall into group B and need to be assessed to determine if the disease is still present. This can be done through integrated surveillance with other diseases, especially skin-related neglected tropical diseases.\nIn 2020, 87 877 suspected yaws cases were reported to WHO from 11 countries, but only 346 cases were confirmed in 7 countries, with the majority of cases coming from the Western Pacific Region (Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu).

These tests cannot distinguish yaws from syphilis, however, and the interpretation of results from these tests in adults who live in yaws endemic areas therefore needs careful clinical assessment. About 40% of ulcers clinically misidentified as yaws are caused by the unrelatedH. ducreyibacterium.\nTreponemal rapid tests are widely available and cheap; however, they cannot distinguish between past and current infection and therefore have limited use in monitoring interruption of transmission. Dual Path Platform Syphilis Screen and Confirm assay (Chembio Diagnostics, USA) can detect both past and present infection.\u00a0Because of the high cost of the DPP test, initial screening of suspected yaws cases can be done by the treponemal tests and positives confirmed by the DPP. However, countries may choose to use only DPP if affordability is not a problem.\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology is used to definitively confirm yaws by detecting the DNA in the skin lesions.

People working under stress or with precarious employment conditions are likely to smoke more, exercise less and have an unhealthy diet.\nIn addition to general health care, all workers \u2013 and particularly those in high-risk occupations \u2013 need health services to assess and reduce exposure to occupational risks, as well as medical surveillance for early detection of occupational and work-related diseases and injuries.\nChronic respiratory diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, noise-induced hearing loss and skin problems are the most common occupational diseases. Yet only one third of countries have programmes in place to address these issues.\nWork-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) as well as cardiovascular diseases and depression caused by occupational stress result in increasing rates of long-term illness and absence from work. Occupational NCDs include occupational cancer, chronic bronchitis and asthma caused by air pollution in the workplace and radiation.\nDespite these diseases, in the majority of countries physicians and nurses are not adequately trained to address work-related health problems and many countries do not offer postgraduate education in occupational health."

        "content": "Work-related health problems result in an economic loss of 4\u20136% of GDP for most countries. About 70% of workers do not have any insurance to compensate them in case of occupational diseases and injuries.\nUniversal health coverage combines access to services needed to achieve good health (health promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, including those that address health determinants) with the financial protection that prevents ill health leading to poverty.\nThere are effective interventions to prevent occupational diseases. For example encapsulation of pollution sources, ventilation, noise control, substitution of dangerous chemicals, improvement of furniture and the organization of work.\nThe task of specialized occupational health services is to assess these risks and develop recommendations for prevention of occupational and work-related diseases. Workers at risk need regular medical check-ups to detect any health problem at an early stage, when treatment and modification of the workplace can help avoid permanent damage.\nCurrently, specialized occupational health services are available only for 15% of workers across the world, primarily in big companies that offer health insurance and employment injury benefits. With the ongoing global job crisis, more and more people seek labour in the informal sector without any insurance cover and no occupational health services. Many such workers often also work in hazardous conditions and suffer work-related diseases, injuries and disabilities. In many communities, when the breadwinner falls sick the entire family suffers as there is no social protection.\nPrimary care centres can deliver some basic occupational services for workers in the informal sector and in small enterprises in the community. Most often they carry out workplace visits with recommendations for improvement, and conduct preliminary and periodic medical examinations, diagnosis and reporting of occupational and work-related diseases. Primary care centres could also train and work with health volunteers and workplace safety representatives to implement simple measures for the prevention of occupational diseases and provide advice on safer working methods. The costs of these services varies between US$ 18 and US$ 60 (purchasing power parity) per worker. Their benefits would include:\nimprovements in the workplace even after the first visit;detecting and managing work-related health problems at an early stage; andeducating and involving working communities in the protection of their health.\nResearch has demonstrated that workplace health initiatives can help reduce sick leave absenteeism by 27% and health-care costs for companies by 26%."

Gaps in formal social support mechanisms mean that persons with disabilities are reliant on support from family members to engage in health and community activities, which not only disadvantages them but also their caregivers (who are mostly women and girls).\nRisk factors:Persons with disabilities are more likely to have risk factors for non-communicable diseases, such as smoking, poor diet, alcohol consumption and a lack of physical activity. A key reason for this is that they are often left out of public health interventions.\nHealth system:Persons with disabilities face barriers in all aspects of the health system.

MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using other drugs, which tend to be more expensive and toxic.\nIn some cases, extensively drug resistant TB or XDR-TB can develop. TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective drugs in MDR-TB treatment regimens can leave patients with very limited treatment options.\nMDR-TB remains a public health crisis and a health security threat. Only about 2 in 5 people with multidrug resistant TB accessed treatment in 2023.\nIn accordance with WHO guidelines, detection of MDR-TB requires bacteriological confirmation of TB and testing for drug resistance using rapid molecular tests or culture methods.\nIn 2022, new WHO guidelines prioritized a short 6-month all-oral regimen known as BPaLM/BPaL as a treatment of choice for eligible patients. Globally in 2023, 5646 people with MDR/RR-TB were reported to have been started treatment on the BPaLM/BPaL regimen, up from 1744 in 2022. The shorter duration, lower pill burden and high efficacy of this novel regimen can help ease the burden on health systems and save precious resources to further expand the diagnostic and treatment coverage for all individuals in need.

The rise has occurred similarly among both boys and girls: in 2022 19% of girls and 21% of boys were overweight.\nWhile just 2% of children and adolescents aged 5\u201319 were obese in 1990 (31 million young people), by 2022, 8% of children and adolescents were living with obesity (160 million young people)."

In a subgroup of patients, single major etiological factors can be identified (medications, diseases, immobilization, iatrogenic procedures, monogenic disease/genetic syndrome).\nThe obesogenic environment exacerbating the likelihood of obesity in individuals, populations and in different settings is related to structural factors limiting the availability of healthy sustainable food at locally affordable prices, lack of safe and easy physical mobility into the daily life of all people, and absence of adequate legal and regulatory environment.\nAt the same time, the lack of an effective health system response to identify excess weight gain and fat deposition in their early stages is aggravating the progression to obesity."

Children with obesity are very likely to be adults with obesity and are also at a higher risk of developing NCDs in adulthood.\nThe economic impacts of the obesity epidemic are also important. If nothing is done, the global costs of overweight and obesity are predicted to reach US$ 3 trillion per year by 2030 and more than US$ 18 trillion by 2060(2).\nFinally, the rise in obesity rates in low-and middle-income countries, including among lower socio-economic groups, is fast globalizing a problem that was once associated only with high-income countries."

Obesity is a societal rather than an individual responsibility, with the solutions to be found through the creation of supportive environments and communities that embed healthy diets and regular physical activity as the most accessible, available and affordable behaviours of daily life.\nStopping the rise in obesity demands multisectoral actions such as food manufacturing, marketing and pricing and others that seek to address the wider determinants of health (such as poverty reduction and urban planning).\nSuch policies and actions include:\nstructural, fiscal and regulatory actions aimed at creating healthy food environments that make healthier food options available, accessible and desirable; andhealth sector responses designed and equipped to identify risk, prevent, treat and manage the disease. These actions need to build upon and be integrated into broader efforts to address NCDs and strengthen health systems through a primary health care approach.\nThe food industry can play a significant role in promoting healthy diets by:\nreducing the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods;ensuring that healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable to all consumers;restricting marketing of foods high in sugars, salt and fats, especially those foods aimed at children and teenagers; andensuring the availability of healthy food choices and supporting regular physical activity practice in the workplace."

To achieve the goal of access to high quality health services for all, governments should take an integrated approach and work with different key actors within the health system and beyond, including individuals and communities. Thesuccess and sustainabilityof efforts to improve quality of care is dependent on effective integration of health actions and programmes across different levels of the health system.\nNational strategic direction on quality:National policies and strategiesaimed at improving quality of care are essential to ensure action across the health system and need to be closely aligned with broader national health policy and planning. The national quality policy and strategy identifies a pragmatic package of interventions to strengthen the system environment, reduce harm, improve clinical care, and engage patients, families and communities. Anillustrative listof interventions for each of these areas is available for countries to consider.\nQuality across the health system:In addition to an enabling policy environment, the provision of quality health services requires good governance; skilled and competent health workforce that is supported and motivated; financing mechanisms that enable and encourage quality care; information systems that continuously monitor and learn to drive better care; medicines, medical devices and technologies that are available, safe and appropriately regulated; and accessible and well-equipped health care facilities.\nQuality-driven primary health care approach:Primary health care (PHC) is pivotal for building a high quality health system and achieving universal health coverage.Careful considerationis needed to ensure PHC-oriented health systems deliver effective, safe and user-centred health services. PHC can not only improve quality from the perspective of people but also enhance their trust in the health system.\nMonitoring and evaluation:Quality of care needs to be continuallymeasuredto monitor progress towards improvement goals. This requires context-specific indicators and accurate, timely and actionable data. The integration of global and national measurement efforts is critical to ensuring that countries collect data that matters and use that data to transform and improve their service delivery systems. The role, for instance, ofadverse event reporting and learning systemsis critical in this context.\nData-driven response and learning systems:It is critical to document and share on-the-ground experiences related to quality of care efforts. This is key to understand the realities of the health system, what works and what doesn\u2019t work. Such knowledge, emerging from implementation experiences must be shared globally and within the countries.\nEngaging users and communities: To improve quality of care, health systems need to listen to and learn from the population they serve.Understanding people\u2019s viewscan provide valuable insights on what is important for them. Robust and regular dialogue between governments and their population fosters trust as people feel that the policy-makers listen to their needs and interests and consider their perspectives(6)."

Heatstroke is a medical emergency with a high-case fatality rate.The number of people exposed to extreme heat is growing exponentially due to climate change in all world regions. Heat-related mortality for people over 65 years of age increased by approximately 85% between 2000\u20132004 and 2017\u20132021(1).Between 2000\u20132019 studies show approximately 489 000 heat-related deaths occur each year, with 45% of these in Asia and 36% in Europe(2). In Europe alone in the summer of 2022, an estimated 61 672 heat-related excess deaths occurred(3). High intensity heatwave events can bring high acute mortality; in 2003, 70 000 people in Europe died as a result of the June\u2013August event. In 2010, 56 000 excess deaths occurred during a 44\u2013day heatwave in the Russian Federation.Vulnerability to heat is shaped by both physiological factors, such as age and health status, and exposure factors such as occupation and socio-economic conditions.The negative health impacts of heat are predictable and largely preventable with specific public health and multi-sectoral policies and interventions. WHO has issuedguidance for public health institutionsto identify andmanageextreme heat risks. Action on climate change combined with comprehensive preparedness and risk management can save lives now and in the future."

        "content": "A heatwave is a period where local excess heat accumulates over a sequence of unusually hot days and nights. Heatwaves and prolonged excess heat conditions are increasing in frequency, duration, intensity and magnitude due to climate change. Even low and moderate intensity heat waves can impact the health and well-being of vulnerable populations.\nThe frequency and intensity of extreme heat and heat waves will continue to rise in the 21st century because of climate change. Extended periods of high day and nighttime temperature conditions create cumulative stress on the human body, increasing the risk of illness and death from heat exposure. Heatwaves can acutely impact large populations for short periods of time, often trigger public health emergencies, and result in excess mortality and cascading socioeconomic impacts (for example, lost work capacity and labour productivity). They can also cause loss of health service delivery capacity, when power shortages accompany heatwaves and disrupt health facilities, transport and water infrastructure.\nPopulation ageing and the growing prevalence of non-communicable diseases (respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, dementia, renal disease and musculoskeletal disease) means that populations are becoming more susceptible to negative heat impacts. Cities are not being designed to minimize the accumulation and generation of urban heat, with a loss of greenspace and inappropriate housing materials (for example, metal roofs) that amplify human exposure to excess heat.\nAwareness among health workers and the public remains insufficient of the health risks posed by heat. Health professionals should adjust their guidance, planning and interventions to account for increasing heat exposures, as well as to manage acute increases in admissions associated with heatwaves. Practical, feasible and often low-cost interventions at the individual, community, organizational, governmental and societal levels can save lives."

Heat can affect health through a variety of direct and indirect mechanisms. There is limited research on the impact of chronic (sustained) exposure to high temperatures and humidity.\nOutdoor and manual workers, athletes and civil protection employees are exposed to excess heat because of their work and susceptible to exertional heat stress.\nUrban and rural poor are often disproportionately exposed to overheating due to low quality housing and lack of access to cooling. Due to building materials, informal settlements are often hotter than other urban areas in some cities. Gender can play an important role in determining heat exposure, for example where women are primarily responsible for cooking indoors during hot weather.\nInfographic: Main heat vulnerability factors"

The strain put on the body as it tries to cool itself also stresses the heart and kidneys. As a result, heat extremes can worsen health risks from chronic conditions (cardiovascular, mental, respiratory and diabetes related conditions) and cause acute kidney injury.\nDeaths and hospitalizations triggered by extreme hot weather occur rapidly (same day and following days), which means interventions also need to be rapid when a heat alert is issued.\nHeat can also disrupt and compromise essential health services, such as the loss of power supply and transport. Heat will reduce working productivity and increases the risk of accidents. It is difficult to complete work or learning in very hot weather and heatwaves may lead schools and other institutions to close. Heatwaves can also be associated with hazardous air pollution events.\nThe scale and nature of the health impacts of heat depend on the timing, intensity and duration of a heat event, and the level of acclimatization and adaptability of the local population, infrastructure and institutions to the prevailing climate.\nInfographic: Scale and nature of the health impacts of heat"

One to three decades after infection, up to a third of patients suffer from cardiac disorders and up to 1 in 10 suffer from digestive (typically enlargement of the oesophagus or colon), neurological or mixed alterations.

Treatment is also indicated for patients in whom infection has been reactivated (for example, due to immunosuppression), and during the early chronic phase, including for girls and women of childbearing age (before or after pregnancy) to prevent congenital transmission.\nAdults with infection, especially those with no symptoms, should be offered treatment because antiparasitic medicines can also prevent or curb disease progression. In other cases, the potential benefits in preventing or delaying the development of Chagas disease should be weighed against the duration of treatment (up to 2 months) and possible adverse reactions (occurring in up to 40% of adults). Benznidazole and nifurtimox should not be administered to pregnant women or people with kidney or liver failure.

Blood screening is necessary to prevent infection through transfusion, organ transplantation, and congenital transmission, and to increase detection and care of the affected population all over the world.\nDepending on the geographical area, WHO recommends the following approaches to prevention and control:\ndevelopment of information, education and      communication materials and activities, contextualized for the different      scenarios and actors, and based on a One Health approach;early access to diagnosis, treatment and      follow up;screening of newborns and other children      of infected mothers;screening of blood donors;testing of organ, tissue or cell donors      and receivers;spraying of dwellings and surrounding      areas with residual insecticides;house improvements and house cleanliness      to prevent vector infestation; andpersonal preventive measures such as      bednets, good hygiene practices in food preparation, transportation,      storage and consumption.\nThe medical care cost of patients with chronic cardiac, digestive, neurologic or mixed forms of the disease has been calculated to be >80% higher than the cost of spraying residual insecticide to control vectors and prevent infection.\nAll health professionals, beginning at the first level of care (primary health care), and appropriately trained and updated, have a crucial role in enhancing the detection, treatment, follow-up, and notification of cases.\nAssessment of the available diagnostics (including rapid serologic or chemiluminescence tests, molecular biology tests) and the most cost-effective algorithms is fundamental to increase early case detection.\nInnovation, research and development, and evaluation of new diagnostics and medicines can accelerate the path towards the elimination of the disease as a public health problem.\nPromotion of biomedical, psychosocial and environmental studies focused on the determinants and risk factors of Chagas disease is essential to identify novel approaches for prevention and control.\nNational information systems are essential to monitor the number of acute and chronic cases and the active transmission routes. However, they are only in place in 6 out of the 44 countries that have reported cases so far."

The use of insecticide-treated bed nets is limited by the fact thatAedesmosquitos bite during the daytime.\nBoth vector surveillance and control are components of the prevention and control of vector-borne diseases, especially for transmission control in epidemic situations. For yellow fever, vector surveillance targetingAedes aegyptiand otherAedesspecies will help inform where there is a risk of an urban outbreak.\n3. Epidemic preparedness and response\nPrompt detection of yellow fever and rapid response through emergency vaccination campaigns are essential for controlling outbreaks. However, underreporting is a concern; WHO estimates the true number of cases to be 10 to 250 times what is now being reported.\nWHO recommends that every at-risk country has at least one national laboratory where basic yellow fever blood tests can be performed. \u00a0A confirmed case of yellow fever in an unvaccinated population is considered an outbreak.

The risk of drowning increases when children interact with water outside of active adult supervision.\nChildren and young adults aged 0\u201329 years account for over half (57%) of all drowning deaths. The highest drowning rates per population are among children aged 0\u20134 years. At the regional level, drowning rates among children 0-4 years are highest in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region at 16.8 deaths per 100\u00a0:000 population. In the WHO Western Pacific Region children aged 5\u201314 years die more frequently from drowning than any other cause.\nThe drowning death rate among males is more than twice as high as females. Males are also more likely to be hospitalized than females for non-fatal drowning. Studies suggest that the higher drowning rates among males are due to increased exposure to water and riskier behaviour such as swimming alone, drinking alcohol before swimming alone and boating.\nDrowning disproportionately affects poor and marginalized people. Whether it be through the use of ponds, rivers or lakes for bathing and washing clothing, or using open wells for collecting water, the pattern of daily exposure in low- and middle-income countries brings a higher risk of drowning.\nIndividuals with occupations such as commercial or subsistence fishing face a substantially higher risk of drowning. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that more than 32\u00a0000 fishers die while working every year. Climate change has aggravated the hazardous conditions under which most fishers work, as extreme weather and natural disasters become more prevalent and destructive.\nClimate change is causing more extreme weather events, such as floods and heatwaves. Drowning accounts for 75% of deaths in flood disasters. Drowning risks due to floods are particularly high in low- and middle-income countries where early warning systems and flood mitigation infrastructure are underdeveloped.\nHeatwaves increase the risk of drowning. As temperatures rise, more people seek water for heat relief and typically spend longer periods of time in and on the water.\nTravelling on water, particularly in dangerous weather conditions or without appropriate safety equipment, can increase drowning risk. In many low- and middle-income countries, water transport is significantly less regulated than in high-income countries. Daily commuting often takes place on overcrowded and unsafe vessels, operated by staff who have not been trained to recognize hazardous conditions or perform high-seas navigation.\nIncreasing numbers of people are being displaced or migrating due to conflict, political and or economic instability and climate change. Many people resort to irregular channels for migration that are extremely hazardous, including across large expanses of water in treacherous conditions, often using overcrowded, unsafe vessels that lack safety equipment or are operated by untrained personnel.\nThere are many actions to prevent drowning. Covering wells, using doorway barriers and playpens, fencing swimming pools and otherwise controlling access to water hazards greatly reduces water hazard exposure and risk.\nCommunity-based, supervised childcare for pre-school children can reduce drowning risk and has other proven health benefits. Teaching school-age children basic swimming, water safety and safe rescue skills is another approach. But these efforts must be undertaken with an emphasis on safety, and an overall risk management that includes a safety-tested curricula, a safe training area, screening and student selection, and student-instructor ratios established for safety.\nPreventing drowning: Practical guidance for the provision of day-care, basic swimming and water safety skills, and safe rescue and resuscitation training (2022)\nA WHO investment case modelling investment in drowning prevention between now and 2050 shows scaling up just two interventions to be cost-saving. Through investing in day-care programmes for pre-school children and teaching children basic swim skills, 774\u00a0000 fewer children would drown between now and 2050. Furthermore, another 178\u00a0000 children would avoid severe, life-limiting injuries due to non-fatal drowning over the same period. Scaling these two interventions is projected to result in savings of over US$\u00a0400\u00a0billion \u2013 a return of 9 times the value of the cost of scaling up the interventions.\nHidden depths: the global investment case for drowning prevention\nEffective policies and legislation are also important for drowning prevention. Setting and enforcing safe boating, shipping and ferry regulations are vital to improving safety on the water and preventing drowning. Building resilience to flooding and managing flood risks through better disaster preparedness planning, land use planning, and early warning systems can prevent drowning during flood disasters.\nDeveloping a national water safety strategy can provide strategic direction and a framework to guide multisectoral action and allow for monitoring and evaluation of efforts."

Roughly 1 in 3 of these deaths result from road traffic crashes, 1 in 6 from suicide, 1 in 10 from homicide and 1 in 61 from war and conflict.\nFor people age 5-29 years, 3 of the top 5 causes of death are injury-related, namely road traffic injuries, homicide and suicide. Drowning is the sixth leading cause of death for children age 5-14 years. Falls account for over 684,000 deaths each year and are a growing and under-recognized public health issue.\nTens of millions more people suffer non-fatal injuries each year which lead to emergency department and acute care visits, hospitalizations or treatment by general practitioners and often result in temporary or permanent disability and the need for long-term physical and mental health care and rehabilitation. For example, there has been a significant rise in road traffic injuries in the African region since 2000, with an almost 50% increase in healthy life-years lost."

For these reasons, preventing injuries and violence, including by breaking intergenerational cycles of violence, goes beyond avoiding the physical injury to contributing to substantial health, social and economic gains.\nInjuries and violence are a significant cause of death and burden of disease in all countries; however, they are not evenly distributed across or within countries \u2013 some people are more vulnerable than others depending on the conditions in which they are born, grow, work, live and age. For instance, in general, being young, male and of low socioeconomic status all increase the risk of injury and of being a victim or perpetrator of serious physical violence. The risk of fall-related injuries increases with age.\nTwice as many males than females are killed each year as a result of injuries and violence. Worldwide, about three quarters of deaths from road traffic injuries, four fifths of deaths from homicide, and two thirds of deaths from war are among men. In many low- and middle-income countries, however, women and girls are more likely to be burned than men and boys, in large part due to exposure to unsafe cooking arrangements and energy poverty. Across all ages, the three leading causes of death from injuries for males are road traffic injuries, homicide and suicide, while for females they are road traffic injuries, falls and suicide.\nPoverty also increases the risk of injury and violence. About 90% of injury-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Across the world, injury death rates are higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. Even within countries, people from poorer economic backgrounds have higher rates of fatal and non-fatal injuries than people from wealthier economic backgrounds. This holds true even in high-income countries.\nThe uneven distribution of injuries that makes them more prevalent among the less advantaged is related to several risk factors. These include living, working, travelling and going to school in more precarious conditions, less focus on prevention efforts in underprivileged communities, and poorer access to quality emergency trauma care and rehabilitation services. These issues are explained in more detail below."

For example, with regard to child injury prevention, a study found that every US$ 1 invested in smoke detectors saves US$ 65, in child restraints and bicycle helmets saves US$ 29, and in-home visitation saves US$ 6 in medical costs, loss productivity and property loss. In Bangladesh, teaching school-age children swimming and rescue skills returned US$ 3000 per death averted. The social benefits of injuries prevented through home modification to prevent falls have been estimated to be at least six times the cost of intervention.

MLCC is a model of care in which a midwife or a team of midwives provide care to the same woman throughout her pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period, calling upon medical support if necessary.\nWith the increase in facility births (almost 80% globally), there is a great opportunity for providing essential newborn care and identifying and managing high risk newborns. However, few women and newborns stay in the facility for the recommended 24 hours after birth, which is the most critical time when complications can present. In addition, too many newborns die at home because of early discharge from the hospital, barriers to access and delays in seeking care. The four recommended postnatal care contacts delivered at health facility or through home visits play a key role to reach these newborns and their families.\nAccelerated progress for neonatal survival and promotion of health and well-being requires strengthening quality of care as well as ensuring availability of quality health services or the small and sick newborn."

Many studies have sought to identify the causes of childhood cancer, but very few cancers in children are caused by environmental or lifestyle factors. Cancer prevention efforts in children should focus on behaviours that will prevent the child from developing preventable cancer as an adult.\nSome chronic infections, such as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus and malaria, are risk factors for childhood cancer. They are particularly relevant in LMICs. Other infections can increase a child\u2019s risk of developing cancer as an adult, so it is important to be vaccinated (against hepatitis B to help prevent liver cancer and against human papillomavirus to help prevent cervical cancer) and to other pursue other methods such as early detection and treatment of chronic infections that can lead to cancer.\nCurrent data suggest that approximately 10% of all children with cancer have a predisposition because of genetic factors(3).

        "content": "Because it is generally not possible to prevent cancer in children, the most effective strategy to reduce the burden of cancer in children and improve outcomes is to focus on a prompt, correct diagnosis followed by effective, evidence-based therapy with tailored supportive care.\nWhen identified early, cancer is more likely to respond to effective treatment and result in a greater probability of survival, less suffering, and often less expensive and less intensive treatment. Significant improvements can be made in the lives of children with cancer by detecting cancer early and avoiding delays in care. A correct diagnosis is essential to treat children with cancer because each cancer requires a specific treatment regimen that may include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.\nEarly diagnosisconsists of 3 components:\nawareness\u00a0of symptoms by families and primary care providers;accurate and timely clinical evaluation, diagnosis, and staging (determining the extent to which a cancer has spread); andaccess to prompt treatment.\nEarly diagnosis is relevant in all settings and improves survival for many cancers. Programmes to promote early and correct diagnosis have been successfully implemented in countries of all income levels, often through the collaborative efforts of governments, civil society and nongovernmental organizations, with vital roles played by parent groups. Childhood cancer is associated with a range of warning symptoms, such as fever, severe and persistent headaches, bone pain and weight loss, that can be detected by families and by trained primary health-care providers.\nScreening is generally not helpful for childhood cancers. In some select cases, it can be considered in high-risk populations. For example, some eye cancers in children can be caused by a mutation that is inherited, so if that mutation or disease is identified in the family of a child with retinoblastoma, genetic counselling can be offered and siblings monitored with regular eye examinations early in life. Genetic causes of childhood cancers are relevant in only a small proportion children with cancer. There is no high-quality evidence to support population-based screening programmes in children.\nA correct diagnosis is essential to prescribe appropriate therapy for the type and extent of the disease. Standard therapies include chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy. Children also need special attention to their continued physical and cognitive growth and nutritional status, which requires a dedicated, multi-disciplinary team. Access to effective diagnosis, essential medicines, pathology, blood products, radiation therapy, technology and psychosocial and supportive care are variable and inequitable around the world.\nHowever, cure is possible for more than 80% of children with cancer when childhood cancer services are accessible. Pharmacological treatment, for example, includes inexpensive generic medications included on theWHO List of essential medicines for children. Children who complete treatment require ongoing care to monitor for cancer recurrence and to manage any possible long-term impact of treatment.\nPalliative care relieves symptoms caused by cancer and improves the quality of life of patients and their families. Not all children with cancer can be cured, but relief of suffering is possible for everyone. Paediatric palliative care is considered a core component of comprehensive care, starting when the disease is diagnosed and continuing throughout treatment and care, regardless of whether a child receives treatment with curative intent.\nPalliative care programmes can be delivered through community and home-based care, providing pain relief and psychosocial support to patients and their families. Adequate access to oral morphine and other pain medicines should be provided for the treatment of moderate to severe cancer pain, which affects more than 80% of cancer patients in the terminal phase."

A vast majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild and self-managed, and hence the actual numbers of dengue cases are under-reported. Many cases are also misdiagnosed as other febrile illnesses(1).\nThe highest number of dengue cases was recorded in 2023, affecting over 80 countries in all regions of WHO. Since the beginning of 2023 ongoing transmission, combined with an unexpected spike in dengue cases, resulted in a historic high of over 6.5 million cases and more than 7300 dengue-related deaths reported.\nSeveral factors are associated with the increasing risk of spread of the dengue epidemic: the changing distribution of the vectors (chieflyAedes aegyptiandAedes albopictusmosquitoes), especially in previously dengue na\u00efve countries; the consequences of El Ni\u00f1o phenomena in 2023 and climate change leading to increasing temperatures and high rainfall and humidity; fragile health systems in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic; and political and financial instabilities in countries facing complex humanitarian crises and high population movements.\nOne modelling estimate indicates 390\u00a0million dengue virus infections per year of which 96\u00a0million manifest clinically(2). Another study on the prevalence of dengue estimates that 3.9\u00a0billion people are at risk of infection with dengue viruses(3).\nThe disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in the WHO Regions of Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. The Americas, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected, with Asia representing around 70% of the global disease burden.\nDengue is spreading to new areas in Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean and South America.\nThe largest number of dengue cases reported was in 2023. The WHO Region of the Americas reported 4.5\u00a0million cases, with 2300 deaths.

        "heading": "Transmission",
        "content": "Transmission through the mosquito bite\nThe dengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes, primarily theAedes aegyptimosquito. Other species within theAedesgenus can also act as vectors, but their contribution is normally secondary toAedes aegypti. However, in 2023, a surge in local transmission of dengue byAedes albopictus(tiger mosquito) has been seen in Europe.\nAfter feeding on a infected person, the virus replicates in the mosquito midgut before disseminating to secondary tissues, including the salivary glands. The time it takes from ingesting the virus to actual transmission to a new host is termed the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). The EIP takes about 8\u201312 days when the ambient temperature is between 25\u201328\u00b0C. Variations in the extrinsic incubation period are not only influenced by ambient temperature; several factors such as the magnitude of daily temperature fluctuations, virus genotype, and initial viral concentrationcan also alter the time it takes for a mosquito to transmit the virus. Once infectious, themosquito can transmit the virus for the rest of its life.\nHuman-to-mosquito transmission\nMosquitoes can become infected by people who are viremic with the dengue virus. This can be someone who has a symptomatic dengue infection, someone who is yet to have a symptomatic infection (they are pre-symptomatic), and also someone who shows no signs of illness (they are asymptomatic).\nHuman-to-mosquito transmission can occur up to 2 days before someone shows symptoms of the illness, and up to 2 days after the fever has resolved.\nThe risk of mosquito infection is positively associated with high viremia and high fever in the patient; conversely, high levels of DENV-specific antibodies are associated with a decreased risk of mosquito infection. Most people are viremic for about 4\u20135 days, but viremia can last as long as 12 days.\nMaternal transmission\nThe primary mode of transmission of the dengue virus between humans involves mosquito vectors. There is evidence however, of the possibility of maternal transmission (from a pregnant mother to her baby). At the same time, vertical transmission rates appear low, with the risk of vertical transmission seemingly linked to the timing of the dengue infection during the pregnancy. When a mother does have a dengue infection when she is pregnant, babies may suffer from pre-term birth, low birthweight, and fetal distress.\nOther transmission modes\nRare cases of transmission via blood products, organ donation and transfusions have been recorded. Similarly, transovarial transmission of the virus within mosquitoes have also been recorded."

The reservoir of this pathogen appears to be mainly cattle. In addition, other ruminants such as sheep, goats, deer are considered significant reservoirs, while other mammals (such as pigs, horses, rabbits, dogs, and cats) and birds (such as chickens and turkeys) have been found infected.\nE. coliO157:H7 is transmitted to humans primarily through consumption of contaminated foods, such as raw or undercooked ground meat products and raw milk. Faecal contamination of water and other foods, as well as cross-contamination during food preparation (with beef and other meat products, contaminated surfaces and kitchen utensils), will also lead to infection. Examples of foods implicated in outbreaks ofE. coliO157:H7 include undercooked hamburgers, dried cured salami, unpasteurized fresh-pressed apple cider, yogurt, and cheese made from raw milk.\nAn increasing number of outbreaks are associated with the consumption of fruits and vegetables (including sprouts, spinach, lettuce, coleslaw, and salad) whereby contamination may be due to contact with faeces from domestic or wild animals at some stage during cultivation or handling. STEC has also been isolated from bodies of water (such as ponds and streams), wells and water troughs, and has been found to survive for months in manure and water-trough sediments. Waterborne transmission has been reported, both from contaminated drinking-water and from recreational waters.\nPerson-to-person contact is an important mode of transmission through the oral-faecal route. An asymptomatic carrier state has been reported, where individuals show no clinical signs of disease but are capable of infecting others. The duration of excretion of STEC is about 1 week or less in adults but can be longer in children. Visiting farms and other venues where the general public might come into direct contact with farm animals has also been identified as an important risk factor for STEC infection."

Good hygienic slaughtering practices reduce contamination of carcasses by faeces but do not guarantee the absence of STEC from products.\nEducation in hygienic handling of foods for workers at farms, abattoirs and those involved in the food production is essential to keep microbiological contamination to a minimum. The only effective method of eliminating STEC from foods is to introduce a bactericidal treatment, such as heating (for example, cooking or pasteurization) or irradiation.\nPreventive measures forE. coliO157:H7 infection are similar to those recommended for other foodborne diseases. Basic good food hygiene practices, as described in the WHO \u201cFive keys to safer food\u201d, can prevent the transmission of pathogens responsible for many foodborne diseases, and also protect against foodborne diseases caused by STEC.\nThe five keys to safer food are:\nKeep clean.Separate raw and cooked.Cook thoroughly.Keep food at safe temperatures.Use safe water and raw materials.\nFive keys to safer food manual\nSuch recommendations should in all cases be implemented, especially \"cook thoroughly\" so that the centre of the food reaches at least 70 \u00b0C. Make sure to wash fruits and vegetables carefully, especially if they are eaten raw. If possible, vegetables and fruits should be peeled. Vulnerable populations (such as small children and the elderly) should avoid the consumption of raw or undercooked meat products, raw milk, and products made from raw milk.\nRegular handwashing, particularly before food preparation or consumption and after toilet contact, is highly recommended, especially for people who take care of small children, the elderly or immunocompromised individuals, as the bacterium can be passed from person to person, as well as through food, water and direct contact with animals.\nA number of STEC infections have been caused by contact with recreational water. Therefore, it is also important to protect such water areas, as well as drinking-water sources, from animal waste (4).\nWHO\u2019s \"Five keys to growing safer fruits and vegetables\" provides rural workers who grow fresh fruits and vegetables for themselves, their families and for sale in local markets, with key practices to prevent microbial contamination of fresh produces during planting, growing, harvesting and storing.\nThe five keys to growing safer fruits and vegetables are:\nPractice good personal hygiene.Protect fields from animal faecal contamination.Use treated faecal waste.Evaluate and manage risks from irrigation water.Keep harvest and storage equipment clean and dry.\nFive keys to growing safer fruits and vegetables"

If this trend continues, the proportion of adults not meeting recommended levels of physical activity is projected to rise to 35% by 2030.\nGlobally, there are notable age and gender differences in levels of physical inactivity.\nWomen are less active than men by an average of 5 percentage points. This has not changed since 2000.After 60 years of age physical inactivity levels increase in both men and women.81% of adolescents (aged 11\u201317 years) were physically inactive(2).Adolescent girls were less active than adolescent boys, with 85% vs. 78%, not meeting WHO guidelines.\nMany different factors can determine how active people are and the overall levels of physical activity in different population groups.

That is more than 1 in 10 babies. Approximately 900\u00a0000 children die in 2019 of complications of preterm birth(1). Many survivors face a lifetime of disability, including learning disabilities and visual and hearing problems.\nGlobally, prematurity is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years. Inequalities in survival rates around the world are stark. In low-income settings, half of the babies born at or below 32 weeks (2 months early) die due to a lack of feasible, cost-effective care such as warmth, breastfeeding support and basic care for infections and breathing difficulties. In high-income countries, almost all these babies survive.

These includeantenatal steroidsandtocolytic treatmentsto delay labour and antibiotics for preterm prolabour rupture of membranes (PPROM).\nIn 2022, WHO also publishednew recommendations on the care of the preterm infant. These reflect new evidence that simple interventions such as kangaroo mother care immediately after birth, early initiation of breastfeeding, use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and medicines such as caffeine for breathing problems can substantially reduce mortality in preterm and low birthweight babies.\nWHO guidance stresses the need to ensure the mother and family take the pivotal role in their baby\u2019s care. Mothers and newborns should remain together from birth and not be separated unless the baby is critically ill.

Chief among these is protection against gastrointestinal infections which is observed not only in developing but also industrialized countries. Early initiation of breastfeeding, within 1 hour of birth, protects the newborn from acquiring infections and reduces newborn mortality. The risk of mortality due to diarrhoea and other infections can increase in infants who are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all.\nBreast-milk is also an important source of energy and nutrients in children aged 6\u201323 months. It can provide half or more of a child\u2019s energy needs between the ages of 6 and 12 months, and one third of energy needs between 12 and 24 months. Breast milk is also a critical source of energy and nutrients during illness, and reduces mortality among children who are malnourished.\nChildren and adolescents who were breastfed as babies are less likely to be overweight or obese. Additionally, they perform better on intelligence tests and have higher school attendance. Breastfeeding is associated with higher income in adult life. Improving child development and reducing health costs results in economic gains for individual families as well as at the national level.(1)\nLonger durations of breastfeeding also contribute to the health and well-being of mothers: it reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancer and helps space pregnancies\u2013exclusive breastfeeding of babies under 6 months has a hormonal effect which often induces a lack of menstruation. This is a natural (though not fail-safe) method of birth control known as the Lactation Amenorrhoea Method.\nMothers and families need to be supported for their children to be optimally breastfed. Actions that help protect, promote and support breastfeeding include:\nadoption of policies such as the International Labour Organization\u2019s\"Maternity Protection Convention 183\"and\"Recommendation No. 191\", which complements\"Convention No. 183\"by suggesting a longer duration of leave and higher benefits;adoption of the\"International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes\"and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly resolutions;implementation of the\"Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding\"specified in the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, including:skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby immediately after birth and initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of life;breastfeeding on demand (that is, as often as the child wants, day and night);rooming-in (allowing mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day);not giving babies additional food or drink, even water, unless medically necessary;provision of supportive health services with infant and young child feeding counselling during all contacts with caregivers and young children, such as during antenatal and postnatal care, well-child and sick child visits, and immunization; andcommunity support, including mother support groups and community-based health promotion and education activities.\nskin-to-skin contact between mother and baby immediately after birth and initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of life;breastfeeding on demand (that is, as often as the child wants, day and night);rooming-in (allowing mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day);not giving babies additional food or drink, even water, unless medically necessary;\nBreastfeeding practices are highly responsive to supportive interventions, and the prevalence of exclusive and continued breastfeeding can be improved over the course of a few years."

Over 80% of fall-related fatalities occur in low- and middle-income countries, with regions of the Western Pacific and South East Asia accounting for 60% of these deaths. In all regions of the world, death rates are highest among adults over the age of 60 years.\nThough not fatal, approximately 37.3 million falls severe enough to require medical attention occur each year. Globally, falls are responsible for over 38 million DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) lost each year(2),and result in more years lived with disability than transport injury, drowning, burns and poisoning combined.\nWhile nearly 40% of the total DALYs lost due to falls worldwide occurs in children, this measurement may not accurately reflect the impact of fall-related disabilities for older individuals who have fewer life years to lose. In addition, those individuals who fall and suffer a disability, particularly older people, are at a major risk for subsequent long-term care and institutionalization.\nThe financial costs from fall-related injuries are substantial. For people aged 65 years or older, the average health system cost per fall injury in the Republic of Finland and Australia are US$ 3611 and US$ 1049 respectively.

Older people have the highest risk of death or serious injury arising from a fall and the risk increases with age. For example, in the United States of America, 20\u201330% of older people who fall suffer moderate to severe injuries such as bruises, hip fractures, or head trauma. This risk level may be in part due to physical, sensory, and cognitive changes associated with ageing, in combination with environments that are not adapted for an ageing population.\nAnother high risk group is children. Childhood falls occur largely as a result of their evolving developmental stages, innate curiosity in their surroundings, and increasing levels of independence that coincide with more challenging behaviours commonly referred to as \u2018risk taking\u2019. While inadequate adult supervision is a commonly cited risk factor, the circumstances are often complex, interacting with poverty, sole parenthood, and particularly hazardous environments.\nAcross all age groups and regions, both genders are at risk of falls. In some countries, it has been noted that males are more likely to die from a fall, while females suffer more non-fatal falls. Older women and younger children are especially prone to falls and increased injury severity. Worldwide, males consistently sustain higher death rates and DALYs lost. Possible explanations of the greater burden seen among males may include higher levels of risk-taking behaviours and hazards within occupations.\nOther risk factors include:\noccupations at elevated heights or other hazardous working conditions;alcohol or substance use;socioeconomic factors including poverty, overcrowded housing, sole parenthood, young maternal age;underlying medical conditions, such as neurological, cardiac or other disabling conditions;side effects of medication, physical inactivity and loss of balance, particularly among older people;poor mobility, cognition, and vision, particularly among those living in an institution, such as a nursing home or chronic care facility;unsafe environments, particularly for those with poor balance and limited vision."

The common type of stool-based tests is the fecal occult blood test (FOBT). FOBT detects hidden blood in the stool, which can be an indicator of colorectal cancer or polyps. It involves collecting a small sample of stool and sending it to a laboratory for analysis. If blood or abnormal findings are detected in the stool, further diagnostic procedures, such as colonoscopy, are usually recommended to confirm the presence of colorectal cancer or polyps.\nStool-based tests are convenient, non-invasive, and can be effective in detecting colorectal cancer at early stages or identifying precancerous polyps.\nIndividuals with a family history of colorectal cancer or certain genetic conditions may benefit from genetic counselling and genetic testing to assess their risk and determine appropriate screening measures."

Early detection of colorectal cancer can lead to better treatments and outcomes.\nTreatments include:\nsurgeryradiotherapy (radiation)chemotherapytargeted therapyimmunotherapy.\nSurgery is often used in the early stages of cancer if the tumour has not spread to other areas of the body. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can help shrink the tumour.\nDoctors from several disciplines often work together to provide treatment and care of people with colorectal cancer.\nSupportive care is important for people with colorectal cancer. It aims to manage symptoms, provide pain relief, and give emotional support. It can help to increase quality of life for people with colorectal cancer and their families.\na) Early stage disease. The primary treatment for early stage colorectal cancer (i.e. tumour limited to the bowel or local lymph nodes, with no metastatic dissemination to distant organs) is surgical removal of the tumour and nearby lymph nodes. The specific surgical procedure depends on the location of the tumour. It may involve a colectomy (removal of a portion of the colon) or a proctectomy (removal of the rectum). In some cases, a temporary or permanent colostomy or ileostomy may be needed to create an opening for waste elimination. Adjuvant therapy refers to additional treatment given after surgery to lower the risk of cancer recurrence. In early-stage colorectal cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended to kill any remaining cancer cells that cannot be seen or removed during surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy is typically recommended for patients with a higher risk of recurrence, such as those with lymph node involvement or certain tumour characteristics. Sometimes chemotherapy may be given before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) to shrink the tumour. Radiation therapy can be associated in tumours of the last segment of the intestine (rectum) to increase the chance of reduce the size of the tumour.\nAfter treatment, regular follow-up visits and surveillance are essential to monitor for any signs of recurrence or new cancer. Surveillance may include physical examinations, blood tests, and imaging studies (such as CT scans) to detect any potential recurrence at an early stage.\na) Advanced disease.Systemic therapy is the primary treatment approach for metastatic colorectal cancer, as it aims to treat cancer cells throughout the body. Chemotherapy is often used as the first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Combination chemotherapy regimens are commonly used to kill cancer cells or slow down their growth. Targeted therapy may be used in combination with chemotherapy for patients with specific genetic mutations, such as KRAS or BRAF mutations. Immunotherapy drugs may be considered for patients with tumours that exhibit specific genetic markers, such as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR).\nIn some cases, surgery may be recommended for metastatic colorectal cancer to remove tumours that are causing symptoms or blocking the intestine. Localized treatments, such as radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, or radiation therapy, may be used to treat specific areas of metastasis, such as liver metastases. Radiation therapy may be used to help control the disease and manage symptoms, such as pain or bleeding.\nClinical trials offer opportunities to access novel treatments or experimental therapies for patients. Participation in clinical trials helps advance medical knowledge and potentially offers new treatment options."

Women doing domestic chores in infested water, such as washing clothes, are also at risk and can developfemale genital schistosomiasis. Inadequate hygiene and contact with infected water make children especially vulnerable to infection.\nMigration to urban areas and population movements are introducing the disease to new areas. Increasing population size and the corresponding needs for power and water often result in development schemes, and environmental modifications facilitate transmission.\nWith the rise in eco-tourism and travel to remote areas, increasing numbers of tourists are contracting schistosomiasis. At times, tourists present severe acute infection and unusual problems including paralysis.\nUrogenital schistosomiasis is also considered to be a risk factor for HIV infection, especially in women."

Liver enlargement is common in advanced cases and is frequently associated with an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and hypertension of the abdominal\r\n    blood vessels. In such cases there may also be enlargement of the spleen.\nThe classic sign of urogenital schistosomiasis is haematuria (blood in urine). Kidney damage and fibrosis of the bladder and ureter are sometimes diagnosed in advanced cases. Bladder cancer is another possible complication in the later stages. In women,\r\n    urogenital schistosomiasis may present with genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse and nodules in the vulva. In men, urogenital schistosomiasis can induce pathology of the seminal vesicles, prostate and other organs. This\r\n    disease may also have other long-term irreversible consequences, including infertility.\nThe economic and health effects of schistosomiasis are considerable and the disease disables more than it kills. In children, schistosomiasis can cause anaemia, stunting and a reduced ability to learn, although the effects are usually reversible with\r\n    treatment. Chronic schistosomiasis may affect people\u2019s ability to work and in some cases can result in death. The number of deaths due to schistosomiasis is difficult to estimate because of hidden pathologies such as liver and kidney failure,\r\n    bladder cancer and ectopic pregnancies due to female genital schistosomiasis.\nDeaths due to schistosomiasis are currently estimated at11 792globally per year. However, these figures are likely underestimated and need to be reassessed."

It involves regular treatment of all at-risk\r\n    groups. In a few countries, where there is low transmission, the interruption of the transmission of the disease should be aimed for.\nGroups targeted for treatment are:\npre-school-aged children;school-aged children;adults considered to be at risk in endemic areas and people with occupations involving contact with infested water, such as fishermen, farmers, irrigation workers and women whose domestic tasks bring them in contact with infested water; andentire communities living in highly endemic areas.\nWHO recommends treatment of infected preschool aged children based on diagnostic and clinical judgment and their inclusion in large-scale treatment using the paediatric praziquantel formulation.\nThe frequency of treatment is determined by the prevalence of infection in school-age children. In high-transmission areas, treatment may have to be repeated every year for several years. Monitoring is essential to determine the impact of control interventions.\nThe aim is to reduce disease morbidity and transmission towards the elimination of the disease as public health problem. Periodic treatment of at-risk populations will cure mild symptoms and prevent infected people from developing severe, late-stage chronic\r\n    disease. However, a major limitation to schistosomiasis control has been the limited availability of praziquantel, particularly for the treatment of adults. Data for 2021 show that 29.9% of people requiring treatment were reached globally, with a\r\n    proportion of 43.3% of school-aged children requiring preventive chemotherapy for schistosomiasis being treated. A drop of 38% compared to 2019, due to the COVID-19 pandemic which suspended treatment campaigns in many endemic areas.\nPraziquantel is the recommended treatment against all forms of schistosomiasis. It is effective, safe and low-cost. Even though re-infection may occur after treatment, the risk of developing severe disease is diminished and even reversed when treatment\r\n    is initiated and repeated in childhood.\nSchistosomiasis control has been successfully implemented over the past 40 years in several countries, including Brazil, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Mauritius, Islamic Republic of Iran, Oman, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Tunisia and others. In many countries\r\n    it has been possible to scale-up schistosomiasis treatment to the national level and have an impact on the disease in a few years. An assessment of the status of transmission is required in several countries.\nOver the past 10 years there has been scale-up of treatment campaigns in a number of sub-Saharan countries, where most of those at risk live. These treatments campaigns resulted in the decrease of prevalence of schistosomiasis in school age children by\r\n    almost 60%(1)."

Mould growth can occur either before harvest or after harvest, during storage, on/in the food itself often under warm, damp and humid conditions. Most mycotoxins are chemically stable and survive food processing.\nSeveral hundred different mycotoxins have been identified, but the most commonly observed mycotoxins that present a concern to human health and livestock include aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, patulin, fumonisins, zearalenone and nivalenol/deoxynivalenol. Mycotoxins appear in the food chain as a result ofmould infectionofcropsboth before and after harvest. Exposure to mycotoxins can happen either directly by eating infected food or indirectly from animals that are fed contaminated feed, in particular from milk."

        "content": "The effects of some food-borne mycotoxins are acute with symptoms of severe illness appearing quickly after consumption of food products contaminated with mycotoxins. Other mycotoxins occurring in food have been linked to long-term effects on health, including the induction of cancers and immune deficiency. Of the several hundred mycotoxins identified so far, about a dozen have gained the most attention due to their severe effects on human health and their occurrences in food.\nAflatoxins are amongst the most poisonous mycotoxins and are produced by certain moulds (Aspergillus flavusandAspergillus parasiticus) which grow in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains. Crops that are frequently affected byAspergillusspp. include cereals (corn, sorghum, wheat and rice), oilseeds (soybean, peanut, sunflower and cotton seeds), spices (chili peppers, black pepper, coriander, turmeric and ginger) and tree nuts (pistachio, almond, walnut, coconut and Brazil nut). The toxins can also be found in the milk of animals that are fed contaminated feed, in the form of aflatoxin M1. Large doses of aflatoxins can lead to acute poisoning (aflatoxicosis) and can be life threatening, usually through damage to the liver. Aflatoxins have also been shown to be genotoxic, meaning they can damage DNA and cause cancer in animal species. There is also evidence that they can cause liver cancer in humans.\nOchratoxin A is produced by several species ofAspergillusandPenicilliumand is a common food-contaminating\u00a0mycotoxin. Contamination of food commodities, such as cereals and cereal products, coffee beans, dry vine fruits, wine and grape juice, spices and liquorice, occurs worldwide. Ochratoxin A is formed during the storage of crops and is known to cause a number of toxic effects in animal species. The most sensitive and notable effect is kidney damage, but the toxin may also have effects on fetal development and on the immune system. Contrary to the clear evidence of kidney toxicity and kidney cancer due to ochratoxin A exposure in animals, this association in humans is unclear, however effects on kidney have been demonstrated.\nPatulin is a mycotoxin produced by a variety of moulds, particularlyAspergillus,PenicilliumandByssochlamys. Often found in rottingapplesand apple products, patulin can also occur in various mouldy fruits, grains and other foods. Major human dietary sources of patulin are apples and apple juice made from affected fruit. The acute symptoms in animals include liver, spleen and kidney damage and toxicity to the immune system. For humans, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances and vomiting have been reported. Patulin is considered to be genotoxic however a carcinogenic potential has not been demonstrated yet.\nFusarium fungi are common to the soil and produce a range of different toxins, including trichothecenes such as deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV) and T-2 and HT-2 toxins, as well as zearalenone (ZEN) and fumonisins. The formation of the moulds and toxins occur on a variety of different cereal crops. Different fusarium toxins are associated with certain types of cereal. For example, both DON and ZEN are often associated with wheat, T-2 and HT-2 toxins with oats, and fumonisins with maize (corn). Trichothecenes can be acutely toxic to humans, causing rapid irritation to the skin or intestinal mucosa and lead to diarrhoea. Reported chronic effects in animals include suppression of the immune system. ZEN has been shown to have hormonal, estrogenic effects and can cause infertility at high intake levels, particularly in pigs. Fumonisins have been related to oesophageal cancer in humans, and to liver and kidney toxicity in animals."

Mould usually does not grow in properly dried and stored foods, so efficient drying of commodities and maintenance of the dry state, or proper storage, is an effective measure against mould growth and the production of mycotoxins.\nTo minimize the health risk from mycotoxins, people are advised to:\ninspect whole grains (especially corn, sorghum, wheat, rice), dried figs and nuts such as\u00a0peanuts, pistachio, almond, walnut, coconut, Brazil nuts and hazelnuts which are all regularly contaminated with aflatoxins for evidence of mould, and discard any that look mouldy, discoloured, or shrivelled;avoid damage to grains before and during drying, and in storage, as damaged grain is more prone to invasion of moulds and therefore mycotoxin contamination;buy grains and nuts as fresh as possible;make sure that foods are stored properly \u2013 kept free of insects, dry, and not too warm;not keep foods for extended periods of time before being used; andensure a diverse diet \u2013 this not only helps to reduce mycotoxins exposure, but also improves nutrition."

Codex standards are the international reference for national food supplies and for trade in food, so that people everywhere can be confident that the food they buy meets the agreed standards for safety and quality, no matter where it was produced.\nJECFA or ad hoc FAO/WHO scientific expert groups consist of independent, international experts who conduct scientific reviews of all available studies\u00a0and other relevant data on specific mycotoxins. The outcome of such health risk assessments can either be a maximum tolerable intake (exposure) level, or other guidance to indicate the level of health concern (such as the Margin of Exposure), including advice on risk management measures to prevent and control contamination, and on the analytical methods and monitoring and control activities.\nThese tolerable daily intakes are used by governments and international risk managers, such as the Codex Alimentarius Commission, to establish maximum levels for mycotoxins in food. The maximum levels for mycotoxins in food are very low due to their severe toxicity. For example, the maximum levels for aflatoxins set by the Codex in various nuts, grains, dried figs and milk are in the range of 0.5 to 15 \u00b5g/kg (a \u00b5g is one billionth of akilogram). The Codex maximum limit for patulin in apple juice is 50 \u00b5g/L.\nExposure to mycotoxins needs to be kept as low as possible to protect the people. Mycotoxins not only pose a risk to both human and animal health, but also impact food security and nutrition by reducing people\u2019s access to healthy food. WHO encourages national authorities to monitor and ensure that levels of mycotoxins in foodstuff on their market are as low as possible and comply with the both national and international maximum levels, conditions and legislation."

Urban outbreaks were first recorded in Thailand in 1967 and in India in the 1970s(2). Since 2004, outbreaks of CHIKV have become more frequent and widespread, caused partly due to viral adaptations allowing the virus to be spread more easily byAedes albopictusmosquitoes and because CHIKV has been introduced into immunologically na\u00efve populations. CHIKV has now been identified in >110 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.\u00a0Transmission has been interrupted for several years on islands where a high proportion of the population is infected and then immune; however, transmission often persists in countries where large parts of the population have not yet been infected.\nAll regions with established populations ofAedes aegyptiorAedes albopictusmosquitoes have now experienced local mosquito-borne transmission."

These mosquitoes bite primarily during daylight hours andAedes aegyptifeeds both indoors and outdoors. They lay eggs in containers with standing water. Both species feed outdoors, andAe. aegyptialso feeds indoors.\nWhen an uninfected mosquito feeds on a person who has CHIKV circulating in their blood, the mosquito can ingest the virus. The virus then replicates in the mosquito over several days, enters its salivary glands, and can be transmitted into a new human host when the mosquito bites them. The virus again begins to replicate in this newly infected person and reaches high concentrations in their blood, at which point they can further infect other mosquitoes and perpetuate the transmission cycle."

        "content": "In symptomatic patients, CHIKV disease onset is typically 4\u20138 days (range 2\u201312 days) after the bite of an infected mosquito. It is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever, frequently accompanied by severe joint pain. The joint pain is often debilitating and usually lasts for a few days but may be prolonged, lasting for weeks, months or even years. Other common signs and symptoms include joint swelling, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash.\u00a0Since these symptoms overlap with other infections, including those with dengue and Zika viruses, cases can be misdiagnosed. In the absence of significant joint pain, symptoms in infected individuals are usually mild and the infection may go unrecognized.\nMost patients recover fully from the infection; however, occasional cases of eye, heart, and neurological complications have been reported with CHIKV infections. Patients at extremes of the age spectrum are at higher risk for severe disease including newborns infected during delivery to infected mothers or bitten by infected mosquitoes in the weeks after birth, and older people with underlying medical conditions. Patients with severe disease require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage and death.\nOnce an individual is recovered, available evidence suggests they are likely to be immune from future chikungunya infections(4)."

This requires mobilization of communities, who are critical in reducing mosquito breeding sites through emptying and cleaning containers that contain water on a weekly basis, disposing of waste, and supporting local mosquito control programmes.\nDuring outbreaks, insecticides may be sprayed to kill flying adult mosquitoes, applied to surfaces in and around containers where the mosquitoes land, and used to treat water in containers to kill the immature mosquito larvae. This may also be performed by health authorities as an emergency measure to control the mosquito population.\nPeople living in or visiting areas with CHIKV transmission are advised to wear clothing that minimizes skin exposure to the day-biting mosquitoes. Window and door screens should be used to prevent mosquitoes from entering homes. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET, IR3535 or icaridin.\nInsecticide-treated mosquito nets should be used against day-biting mosquitoes by persons who sleep during the daytime, for example young children, sick patients or older people."

People can also develop GBS after having the flu or other viral infections including cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and the Zika virus.\nIn rare instances, vaccinations may increase the risk of people getting GBS, but the chance of this occurring is extremely low. Studies show that people are much more likely to get GBS from infections such as the flu than from the vaccine given to prevent the infection, in this case the flu vaccine.

Opioids have analgesic and sedative effects, and such medicines as morphine, codeine and fentanyl are commonly used for the management of pain. Opioid medicines methadone and buprenorphine are used for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. After intake, opioids can cause euphoria, which is one of the main reasons why they are taken for non-medical reasons. Opioids include heroin, morphine, codeine, fentanyl, methadone, tramadol, and other similar substances. Due to their pharmacological effects, they can cause difficulties with breathing, and opioid overdose can lead to death.\nTheir regular non-medical use, prolonged use, misuse and use without medical supervision can lead to opioid dependence and other health problems. Opioid dependence is a disorder of regulation of opioid use arising from repeated or continuous use of opioids. The characteristic feature of dependence is a strong internal drive to use opioids, which manifests itself by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including increased tolerance to the effects of opioids, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use, or repeated use of opioids or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms(1).\nWorldwide, about 296 million people (or 5.8% of the global population aged 15\u201364 years) used drugs at least once in 2021. Among them, about 60 million people used opioids. About 39.5 million people lived with drug use disorders in 2021(2). Most people dependent on opioids used illicitly cultivated and manufactured heroin, but the proportion of those using prescription opioids is growing."

Close to 80% of these deaths are related to opioids, with about 25% of those deaths caused by opioid overdose. According to WHO estimates, approximately 125 000 people died of opioid overdose in 2019. Opioid overdoses that do not lead to death are several times more common than fatal overdoses.\nThe number of opioid overdoses has increased in recent years in several countries, in part due to the increased availability of opioids used in the management of chronic pain, and also due to increasing use of highly potent opioids appearing on the illicit drug market. In the United States of America (USA) the number of people dying from drug overdose amounted to 70 630 in 2019, and approximately half of these deaths involved synthetic opioids. From 2013 to 2019, the age-adjusted synthetic opioid death rates in the United States increased by 1040%(3). \u00a0\u00a0During the COVID-19 pandemic, a further substantial increase in drug overdose deaths was reported in the USA, primarily driven by rapid increases in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids(4).\nFentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid that is used as a pain reliever and as an anaesthetic. It is approximately 50\u2013100 times more potent than morphine. Fentanyl in various formulations is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. However, fentanyl and its chemically-similar analogues (including carfentanil, acetylfentanyl, butyrfentanyl, and furanyl fentanyl) have been associated with a spike in deaths from opioid overdose. There is evidence that drug dealers may be adding fentanyl to increase the potency of their products (such as heroin) and selling fentanyl as counterfeit tablets, created to look like authentic prescription medications. Therefore, many users who test positive for fentanyl and its analogues do not realize that they took the substance."

Several countries (Australia, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Ukraine) have introduced naloxone as over-the-counter medication and have also started proactive dissemination in communities.\nIn recent years, a number of programmes around the world have shown that providing naloxone to people likely to witness an opioid overdose, in combination with training on the use of naloxone and on the resuscitation of people following an opioid overdose, could substantially reduce the number of deaths resulting from opioid overdose.

Collection of such data is important as information about the patterns of use, misuse and non-medical use\u00a0 of opioids is very limited.\nWHO also supports countries in monitoring trends in drug use and related harm, to better understand the scale of opioid dependence and opioid overdose.\nWHO recommends that naloxone be made available to people likely to witness an opioid overdose, as well as training in the management of opioid overdose. In suspected opioid overdose, first responders should focus on airway management, assisting ventilation and administering naloxone. After successful resuscitation following the administration of naloxone, the level of consciousness and breathing of the affected person should be closely observed until full recovery has been achieved.\nWHO recommends the use of a range of treatment options for opioid dependence. These include opioid agonist maintenance treatment (with medicines such as methadone and buprenorphine), which has the strongest evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, as well as psychosocial treatment and support, and pharmacological treatment with opioid antagonists (such as naltrexone). WHO supports countries in improving the coverage and quality of treatment programmes for opioid dependence and introducing them where they do not already exist.\nWHO also issues normative guidance to promote the appropriate use of opioids for pain and palliative care. Appropriate use and regulation of opioid analgesics ensures that they are available where needed whilst preventing their diversion and harm related to misuse.\nIn 2016, under the framework of the WHO/UNODC Programme on Drug Dependence Treatment and Care, the \u201cStop Overdose Safely (S-O-S)\u201d Initiative was launched, to provide training on recognizing the risk of overdose and providing emergency care in the event of an overdose. As part of this Initiative, a multi-site study on community management of opioid overdose was implemented in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Ukraine in 2019-2020. About 40 000 kits of naloxone were distributed, more than 14 000 people were trained as part of the project and around 90% of those participants who witnessed an overdose reported using naloxone.

Micronutrients enable the body to produce enzymes, hormones and other substances that are essential for proper growth and development.\nIodine, vitamin A, and iron are the most important in global public health terms; their deficiency represents a major threat to the health and development of populations worldwide, particularly children and pregnant women in low-income countries.\nOverweight and obesity is when a person is too heavy for his or her height. Abnormal or excessive fat accumulation can impair health.\nBody mass index (BMI) is an index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify overweight and obesity. It is defined as a person\u2019s weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m\u00b2). In adults, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 or more, whereas obesity is a BMI of 30 or more.Among children and adolescents, BMI thresholds for overweight and obesity vary by age.\nOverweight and obesity result from an imbalance between energy consumed (too much) and energy expended (too little). Globally, people are consuming foods and drinks that are more energy-dense (high in sugars and fats) and engaging in less physical activity.\nDiet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) include cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and stroke, and often linked with high blood pressure), certain cancers, and diabetes. Unhealthy diets and poor nutrition are among the top risk factors for these diseases globally."

Essential medicines lists serve as a basis for procurement and supply of medicines in the public sector, reimbursement and insurance schemes, medicine donations and local medicine production(1). When properly implemented, the essential medicines concept can help improve health outcomes and achieve progress towards universal health coverage. The essential medicines concept has been successfully implemented in various countries and regions. Studies have shown that essential medicines lists are associated with greater availability of essential medicines than non-essential medicines(2), increased access(3), better prescribing and quality of care, and cost savings(4).\nThe essential medicines concept can be adapted to different healthcare systems, settings and income levels.

Medicines requiring specialized medical care have been introduced, such as lung surfactants for newborn babies, targeted cancer treatments and medicines for multiple sclerosis. The Model List has also included more treatments for chronic and noncommunicable diseases, reflecting the changing global disease burden and aging populations.\nWhile the cost of a medicine is a consideration in the selection process, a high absolute cost of a medicine does not necessarily prevent it from being added to the WHO Model List if it otherwise meets the required selection criteria. Since 2002, affordability has evolved from being a precondition of listing a medicine on the Model list to being a consequence. Listing a medicine on the Model List is one step in a series of actions that can lead to lower costs, better affordability and greater access.\nThe number of patented medicines on the Model List has increased over time from 17/319 (5%) in 2003 to 82/502 (16%) in 2023.\nIn 2017, in response to the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, the WHO Model List introduced the AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification of antibiotics. The AWaRe classification guides the empiric use of essential antibiotics for more than 30 clinical infections in community and hospital settings. It has formed the basis of broader guidance for optimal antibiotic prescribing and use, supporting antimicrobial stewardship.(5)."

Trade in live, wild animals can increase the likelihood of infectious diseases jumping over to people\r\n    (called disease spillover).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic put a spotlight on the need for a global framework for improved surveillance and a more holistic, integrated system. Gaps in One Health knowledge, prevention and integrated approaches were seen as key drivers of the pandemic. By\r\n    addressing the linkages between human, animal and environmental health, One Health is seen as a transformative approach to improved global health.\nOne Health applies to a range of issues, include:\nantimicrobial resistance (AMR), which happens when germs like bacteria and parasites develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them and continue growing and spreading;zoonotic diseases, which are infectious diseases that are caused by germs that spread between animals and people, such as Ebola, avian influenza, rabies, etc.;vector-borne diseases, which affect people who get bitten by a vector (mosquitoes, ticks, lice and fleas) and include\u00a0dengue fever, West Nile virus, Lyme disease and malaria;food safety and foodborne diseases, caused by contamination of food and occur at any stage of the food production, delivery and consumption chain, such as norovirus, salmonella, listeria, etc.; andenvironmental health, such as water pollution, air pollution and climate change.\nAccording to the World Bank, the expected benefit of One Health to the global community was estimated in 2022 to be at least\u202fUS$ 37 billion per year. The estimated annual need for expenditure on prevention is less than 10% of these benefits.\nSince 2003, the world has seen over 15 million human deaths and US$ 4 trillion in economic losses due to disease and pandemics, as well as immense losses from food and water safety hazards, which are One Health related health threats."

In such situations, further counselling needs to be given on what other and more regular contraceptive options may be more appropriate and more effective.\nFrequent and repeated ECP use may be harmful for women with conditions classified as medical eligibility criteria (MEC) category 2, 3,or 4 for combined hormonal contraception or Progestin-only contraceptives (POC). Frequent use of emergency contraception can result in increased side-effects, such as menstrual irregularities, although their repeated use poses no known health risks.\nEmergency contraceptive pills were found to be less effective in obese women (whose body mass index is more than 30 kg/m2), but there are no safety concerns. Obese women should not be denied access to emergency contraception when they need it.\nCounselling for use of emergency contraceptive pills should include options for using regular contraception and advice on how to use methods correctly in case of perceived method failure."

This method is particularly appropriate for women who would like to start using a highly effective, long-acting, and reversible contraceptive method.\nWhen inserted within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse, a copper-bearing IUD is more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. This is the most effective form of emergency contraception available. Once inserted, women can continue to use the IUD as an ongoing method of contraception, or may choose to change to another contraceptive method.\nA copper-bearing IUD is a safe form of emergency contraception. It is estimated that there may be less than 2 cases of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) per 1000 users(3). (FP Global Handbook). The risks of expulsion or perforation are low.\nEligibility criteria for general use of a copper IUD also apply for use of a copper IUD for emergency purposes. Women with a condition classified as MEC category 3 or 4 (for example, with current PID, puerperal sepsis, unexplained vaginal bleeding, cervical cancer, or severe thrombocytopenia) for the copper IUD should not use a copper IUD for emergency purposes. In addition, a copper-bearing IUD should not be inserted for emergency contraception following sexual assault as the woman may be at high risk of a sexually transmitted infection such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. A copper-bearing IUD should not be used as emergency contraception when a woman is already pregnant.\nTheWHO Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive usestates that IUD insertion may further increase the risk of PID among women at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), although limited evidence suggests that this risk if low. Current algorithms for determining increased risk of STIs have poor predictive value. Risk of STIs varies by individual behaviour and local STI prevalence. Therefore, while many women at increased risk of STIs can generally have an IUD inserted, some women at a very high likelihood of STIs should generally not have an IUD inserted until appropriate testing and treatment occur.\nMedical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use"

The condition is primarily observed among working-age people, but also in youth. While the prevalence of bipolar disorder among men and women is approximately equal, available data indicate that women are more often diagnosed.\nWorldwide, the treatment coverage for people with bipolar disorder is low. Both men and women are often misdiagnosed. Many lack access to services and recommended interventions, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).\nStigma and discrimination against people with bipolar disorder are widespread, both in communities and health services. This can undermine access to health care. It also fuels social exclusion and can limit opportunities for education, employment and housing.\nBipolar disorder is one of the leading causes of disability globally as it can affect many areas of life. People with bipolar disorder may experience strained relationships, problems at school or work, and difficulties in carrying out daily activities. Having bipolar disorder also increases the risk of suicide and of developing anxiety and substance use disorders.\nPeople with bipolar disorder are more likely to smoke, use alcohol, have a physical health condition (e.g. cardiovascular or respiratory disease), and experience difficulties in accessing health care. On average, people with bipolar disorder die more than 10 years earlier than the general population(2)."

They may have a sense of euphoria, sudden shifts in mood or an excess of emotion (uncontrollable laughing or feeling much more irritable, agitated or restless than usual).\nIn manic episodes, the changes in mood and activities are accompanied by other characteristic symptoms, which may include:\nhighly inflated sense of self-worth or self-esteem;talking quickly and rapidly shifting from one idea to the next;having trouble concentrating and being easily distracted;decreased need for sleep;reckless or risk-taking behaviour, for example overspending, risky sexual activity, drinking, or harming oneself or others; andfixed and mistaken grandiose or persecutory beliefs in something untrue (e.g. \u201cI am a very famous person\u201d, \u201cMy neighbour is spying on me\u201d).\nOn the contrary, during a depressive episode, a person experiences a depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty). They may feel a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that they had previously enjoyed.\nOther symptoms are also present, which may include:\npoor concentrationfeelings of excessive guilt or low self-worthhopelessness about the futurethoughts about dying or suicidedisrupted sleepchanges in appetite or weightfeeling very tired or low in energy.\nA depressive episode is different from mood fluctuations commonly experienced by most people, in that the symptoms last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks.\nBoth manic and depressive episodes can cause significant difficulties in all aspects of life, including at home, work and school. They may require specialized care to prevent the person from doing harm to themselves or others.\nSome people with bipolar disorder may experience what are called hypomanic episodes. Hypomanic episodes involve similar symptoms to manic episodes, but the symptoms are less intense and do not typically disrupt the person\u2019s ability to function to the same extent.\nThere are two main types of bipolar disorder, depending on patterns of manic or hypomanic and depressive episodes.\nPeople withbipolar type I disorderexperience one or more manic episodes interspaced with episodes of depression which usually become more common over time (compared with manic episodes).People withbipolar type II disorderhave had one or more hypomanic episodes and at least one depressive episode, but no history of manic episodes."

Several factors \u2013 including biological (e.g. genetic), psychological, social and structural factors \u2013 may contribute to its onset, trajectory and outcomes.\nAdverse circumstances or life-altering events can trigger or exacerbate the symptoms of bipolar disorder. These may include bereavement, violence or the breakdown of a relationship. The use of alcohol or drugs can also influence the onset and trajectory of bipolar disorder.\nAlthough employment can be a source of stress for people living with bipolar disorder, it can also be protective.

With appropriate care, people with bipolar disorder can cope with their symptoms and live meaningful and productive lives.\nThere are a range of effective treatment options, typically a mix of medicines and psychological and psychosocial interventions. Medicines are considered essential for treatment, but themselves are usually insufficient to achieve full recovery. People with bipolar disorder should be treated with respect and dignity and should be meaningfully involved in care choices, including through shared decision-making regarding treatment and care, balancing effectiveness, side-effects and individual preferences.\nPeople with bipolar disorder need treatment and care across acute episodes of mania and depression and when indicated, longer-term treatment to prevent relapse.\nMood stabilizers (such as lithium, valproate) and antipsychotics are proven to help manage acute mania. Lithium prescription requires clinical and laboratory monitoring. Girls and women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or have childbearing potential should not use valproate. Lithium and carbamazepine also need to be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding whenever possible.\nAntidepressants should not be taken during a manic episode and they may be combined with mood stabilizers or antipsychotics during episodes of depression.\nSome medicines for bipolar disorder can make people feel sleepy, have involuntary muscle spasms or tremors, or experience metabolic changes (e.g. involving weight gain). These side effects can affect adherence to treatment and should be monitored and managed.\nAdults with bipolar disorder who are in complete remission (no symptoms) usually need to continue with mood stabilizers or antipsychotic medicines for at least six months. Those experiencing multiple episodes of mania and depression will usually require longer-term treatment to minimize relapses.\nPeople with bipolar disorder can benefit from lifestyle changes involving regular sleep, physical activity, a healthy diet, reduction of stressors, and mood monitoring.\nPsychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, psychoeducation) can effectively reduce depressive symptoms and the possibility of them coming back.\nFamily psychoeducation can also help families understand and support their loved one better. Support from family and friends is very important. Support groups \u2013 where people can receive encouragement, learn coping skills, and share experiences \u2013 can be helpful to people with bipolar disorder and their families.\nRecovery-oriented psychosocial interventions include supported employment, supported housing, peer support, and social and life skills training. They serve to promote hope and to support the autonomy, personal empowerment and social inclusion of people with bipolar disorder.\nMedicines and psychological or psychosocial interventions should be tailored to the needs of the person and combined for best outcomes."

Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal.\nThe global cost of rabies is estimated to be around US$ 8.6 billion per year including lost lives and livelihoods, medical care and associated costs, as well as uncalculated psychological trauma.\nRabies is present on all continents except Antarctica. Globally there are an estimated 59 000 deaths from rabies annually; however, due to underreporting, documented case numbers often differ from the estimate.\nRabies, a neglected tropical diseases (NTD), predominantly affecting marginalized populations. Although effective human vaccines and immunoglobulins exist for rabies, these are often inaccessible or unaffordable to those in need.\nAs of 2018, the average estimated cost of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)was US$ 108(along with travel costs and loss of income), which can be a financial burden on those earning US$ 1\u20132 per person, daily.\nOver 29 million people worldwide receive human rabies vaccine annually.\nIn the Americas, where dog-mediated rabies is mostly controlled, hematophagous (blood-feeding) bats are now the primary source of human rabies. Bat-mediated rabies is also an emerging public health threat in Australia and parts of western Europe.\nHuman deaths following exposure to foxes, raccoons, skunks, and other wild mammals are very rare, and bites from rodents are not known to transmit rabies.\nContraction of rabies through inhalation of virus-containing aerosols, consumption of raw meat or milk of infected animals, or through organ transplantation is extremely rare.\nHuman-to-human transmission through bites or saliva is theoretically possible but has never been confirmed."

Initial symptoms of rabies include generic signs like fever, pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensations at the wound site. As the virus moves to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. Clinical rabies in people can be managed but very rarely cured, and not without severe neurological deficits.\nThere are two forms of rabies:\nFurious rabiesresults in hyperactivity, excitable behaviour, hallucinations, lack of coordination, hydrophobia (fear of water) and aerophobia (fear of drafts or of fresh air). Death occurs after a few days due to cardio-respiratory arrest.\nParalytic rabiesaccounts for about 20% of the total number of human cases. This form of rabies runs a less dramatic and usually longer course than the furious form. Muscles gradually become paralysed, starting from the wound site. A coma slowly develops and eventually death occurs. The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to the under-reporting of the disease."

Women and girls are both more likely to contract podoconiosis and more likely to suffer from its social and economic consequences.\nInterventions include prevention of contact with the soil through consistent wearing of shoes from an early age and daily foot washing. Treatment using a holistic lymphoedema management package has been demonstrated to decrease swelling, disability and incidence of acute attacks, improve quality of life, and can be readily mainstreamed into government community health services."

Podoconiosis also has severe social and economic consequences. Patients lose 45% of their economically productive time because of morbidity associated with the disease. In Ethiopia alone, it is estimated that podoconiosis causes 172 073 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to be lost annually. Most of these DALYs are due to chronic lymphoedema, and only 2.6% are attributable to ADLA episodes. Podoconiosis is considered the most stigmatizing health problem in endemic areas.

Equity is used as a framework in public health to identify and address unfair and\nremediable health disparities among different sub-populations. HRBA provides legal standards and obligations to put legal protections for equality and non-discrimination into action.\nAddressing discrimination requires attention to overlapping and intersecting factors of discrimination notably gender, race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and socioeconomic status. An intersectional lens allows for the examination of health inequalities driven by multiple grounds of exclusionand for health interventions to be designed in a way that responds to intersecting factors. This would include, for example, ensuring that health information is provided in formats that allow people to access the information they need.\nParticipation: Participation requires empowering health service users, communities and civil society to engage in planning, decision-making and implementation processes for health across the programme cycle and at all levels of the system. To be meaningful, participation must include explicit strategies to address power imbalances, value experiential evidence, and manage conflicts of interest so that the needs and expectations of people are met.Participatory planning techniquescan be used to engage beneficiary populations in designing health services or public spending prioritization.\nAccountability: Countries must establish accessible and effective accountability mechanisms. These may include administrative and judicial remedies and oversight by other institutions, such as national human rights institutions and health and social care regulators. The United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, play a crucial accountability role by regularly reviewing countries\u2019 compliance with their health-related human rights obligations.\nThere is a growing recognition of the importance of regulation of non-State actors, such as the private sector and non-governmental organizations, to ensure they respect and protect human rights. For example, by enacting bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (TAPS), countries are implementing their commitments to manage tobacco control under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. One third of countries (66), representing a quarter of the world\u2019s population, have completely banned all forms of TAPS."

Availability can be measured through the analysis of disaggregated data to different stratifiers including by age, sex, location and socio-economic status and qualitative surveys to understand coverage gaps.\nAccessibilityrequires that health facilities, goods, and services must be accessible to everyone. Accessibility has four dimensions: non-discrimination, physical accessibility, economic accessibility (affordability) and information accessibility. This is particularly important for persons with disabilities who often encounter significant barriers to health related to the inaccessibility of services, facilities and health information.\nAssessingaccessibility requires analysis of physical, geographical, financial and other barriers to health systems and services, and how they may affect people who are marginalized. It requires the establishment or application of clear norms and standards in both law and policy to address these barriers.\nAcceptabilityrelates to respect for medical ethics, culturally appropriate, and sensitivity to gender. Acceptability requires that health facilities, goods, services and programmes are people-centred and cater to the specific needs of diverse population groups and in accordance with international standards of medical ethics for confidentiality and informed consent.\nQualityextends to the underlying determinants of health, for example safe and potable water and sanitation as well as requiring that health facilities, goods, and services are scientifically and medically approved.\nQuality is a key component of universal health coverage (UHC). Quality health services should be:\nsafe: avoiding injuries to people for whom the care is intended;effective: providing evidence-based services to those who need them;people-centred: providing care that responds to individual needs;timely: reducing waiting times and harmful delays;equitable: providing care that does not vary in quality on account of age, gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic location, and socio-economic status;integrated: providing a full range of health services throughout the life course; andefficient: maximizing the benefit of available resources and avoiding waste."

Only some 80 WHO Member States have good-quality vital registration data that can be used directly to estimate suicide rates. This problem of poor-quality mortality data is not unique to suicide, but given the stigma surrounding suicide \u2013 and the illegality of suicidal behaviour in some countries \u2013 it is likely that under-reporting and misclassification are greater problems for suicide than for most other causes of death.\nImproved surveillance and monitoring of suicide and self-harm are required for effective suicide prevention strategies.

This is particularly important in countries that face food shortages.\nTo protect food consumers from the adverse effects of pesticides WHO reviews evidence and develops internationally-accepted maximum residue limits.\nPesticides are used to protect crops against insects, weeds, fungi and other pests.\nPesticides are potentially toxic to humans and can have both acute and chronic health effects, depending on the quantity and ways in which a person is exposed.\nPeople who face the greatest health risks from exposure to pesticides are those who come into contact with them at work, in their home or garden."

Each pesticide has different properties and\r\ntoxicological effects.\nMany of the older, less costly (off-patent) pesticides, such as\r\ndichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and lindane, can remain for years in soil\r\nand water. These chemicals have been banned by countries which signed the 2001\r\nStockholm Convention, an international treaty that aims to eliminate or\r\nrestrict the production and use of persistent organic pollutants.\nThe toxicity of a pesticide depends on its function and other factors. For\r\nexample, insecticides tend to be more toxic to humans than herbicides. The same\r\nchemical can have different effects at different doses, that is, the amount of chemical\r\nto which a person is exposed. Toxicity can also depend on the route by which\r\nthe exposure occurs, such as by swallowing, inhaling or direct contact with the\r\nskin.\nNone of the pesticides currently authorized for use on food in international\r\ntrade are genotoxic (damaging to DNA, which can cause mutations or cancer).\r\nAdverse effects from these pesticides occur only above a certain safe level of\r\nexposure. When people come into contact with large quantities of pesticide, the\r\nresult may be acute poisoning or long-term health effects that may include\r\ncancer and adverse effects on reproduction."

After assessing the level of risk, JMPR establishes limits for safe intake to ensure that the amount of pesticide residue to which people are exposed through eating food over their lifetime will not result in adverse health effects.\nThese acceptable daily intakes are used by governments and international risk managers, such as the Codex Alimentarius Commission (the intergovernmental body that sets food standards), to establish maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides in food. Codex standards are the reference for international trade in food, meaning that consumers everywhere can be confident that the food they buy meets the agreed standards for safety and quality, no matter where it has been produced. Currently there are Codex standards for more than 100 different pesticides.\nWHO and FAO have jointly developed theInternational Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management. The most recent edition of this voluntary framework was published in 2014.

There are two main types of listeriosis: a non-invasive form and an invasive form.\nNoninvasive listeriosis (febrile listerial gastroenteritis) is a mild form of the disease affecting mainly otherwise healthy people. Symptoms include diarrhoea, fever, headache and myalgia (muscle pain). The incubation period is short (a few days). Outbreaks of this disease have generally involved the ingestion of foods containing high doses ofL. monocytogenes.\nInvasive listeriosis is a more severe form of the disease and affects certain high risk groups of the population. These include pregnant women, patients undergoing treatment for cancer, HIV and organ transplants, elderly people and infants. This form of disease is characterized by severe symptoms and a high mortality rate (20\u201330%). The symptoms include fever, myalgia (muscle pain), septicemia, meningitis. The incubation period is usually one to two weeks but can vary between a few days and up to 90 days.\nThe initial diagnosis of listeriosis is made based on clinical symptoms and detection of the bacteria in a smear from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), meconium of newborns (or the fetus in abortion cases), as well as from faeces, vomitus, foods or animal feed. Various detection methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are available for diagnosis of listeriosis in humans. During pregnancy, blood and placenta cultures are the most reliable ways to discover if symptoms are due to listeriosis.\nPregnant women are about 20 times more likely to contract listeriosis than other healthy adults. It can result in miscarriage or stillbirth. Newborn may also have low birth weight, septicaemia and meningitis. People with HIV are at least 300 times more likely to get ill than those with a normally functioning immune system.\nDue to the long incubation period, it is challenging to identify the food which was the actual source of the infection."

Almost all sexually active people will be infected at some point in their lives, usually without symptoms. In most cases the immune system clears HPV from the body. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV can cause abnormal cells to develop, which go on to become cancer.\nPersistent HPV infection of the cervix (the lower part of the uterus or womb, which opens into the vagina \u2013 also called the birth canal) if left untreated, causes 95% of cervical cancers. Typically, it takes 15\u201320 years for abnormal cells to become cancer, but in women with weakened immune systems, such as untreated HIV, this process can be faster and take 5\u201310 years. Risk factors for cancer progression include the grade of oncogenicity of the HPV type, immune status, the presence of other sexually transmitted infections, number of births, young age at first pregnancy, hormonal contraceptive use, and smoking."

The vaccine may be given as 1 or 2 doses. People with reduced immune systems should ideally receive 2 or 3 doses. Some countries have also chosen to vaccinate boys to further reduce the prevalence of HPV in the community and to prevent cancers in men caused by HPV.\nOther important ways to prevent HPV infection include:\nbeing a non-smoker or stopping smokingusing condomsvoluntary male circumcision.\nWomen should be screened for cervical cancer every 5\u201310 years starting at age 30. Women living with HIV should be screened every 3 years starting at age 25. The global strategy encourages a minimum of two lifetime screens with a high-performance HPV test by age 35 and again by age 45 years. Precancers rarely cause symptoms, which is why regular cervical cancer screening is important, even if you have been vaccinated against HPV.\nSelf-collection of a sample for HPV testing, which may be a preferred choice for women, has been shown to be as reliable as samples collected by healthcare providers.\nAfter a positive HPV test (or other screening method) a healthcare provider can look for changes on the cervix (such as precancers) which may develop into\u00a0cervical cancer\u00a0if left untreated. Treatment of precancers is a simple procedure and prevents cervical cancer. Treatment may be offered in the same visit (the see and treat approach) or after a second test (the see, triage and treat approach), which is especially recommended for women living with HIV.\nTreatments of precancers are quick and generally painless causing infrequent complications. Treatment steps include colposcopy or visual inspection of the cervix to locate and assess the lesion followed by:\nthermal ablation, which involves using a heated probe to burn off cells;cryotherapy, which involves using a cold probe to freeze off the cells;LEETZ (large loop excision of the transformation zone), which involves removing your abnormal tissues with an electrically heated loop; and/ora cone biopsy, which involves using a knife to remove a cone-shaped wedge of tissue.\nCervical cancer can be cured if diagnosed and treated at an early stage of disease. Recognizing symptoms and seeking medical advice to address any concerns is a critical step. Women should see a healthcare professional if they notice:\nunusual bleeding between periods, after menopause, or after sexual intercourseincreased or foul-smelling vaginal dischargesymptoms like persistent pain in the back, legs, or pelvisweight loss, fatigue and loss of appetitevaginal discomfortswelling in the legs.\nClinical evaluations and tests to confirm a diagnosis are important and will generally be followed by referral for treatment services, which can include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy as well as palliative care to provide supportive care and pain management.\nManagement pathways for invasive cancer care are important tools to ensure that a patient is referred promptly and supported as they navigate the steps to diagnosis and treatment decisions. Features of quality care include:\na multidisciplinary team ensuring diagnosis and staging (histological testing, pathology, imaging) takes place prior to treatment decisions;treatment decisions in line with national guidelines; andinterventions are supported by holistic psychological, spiritual, physical and palliative care.\nAs low- and middle-income countries scale-up cervical screening, more cases of invasive cervical cancer will be detected, especially in previously unscreened populations. Therefore, referral and cancer management strategies need to be implemented and expanded alongside prevention services."

At present endometriosis is thought to arise due to:\nRetrograde menstruation is when menstrual blood containing endometrial cells flows back through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity at the time that blood is flowing out of the body through the cervix and vagina during periods. Retrograde menstruation can result in endometrial-like cells being deposited outside the uterus where they can implant and grow.Cellular metaplasia is when cells change from one form to another. Cells outside the uterus change into endometrial-like cells and start to grow.Stem cells can give rise to the disease, which then spreads through the body via blood and lymphatic vessels.\nOther factors may also contribute to the growth or persistence of ectopic endometrial tissue. For example, endometriosis is known to be dependent on estrogen, which increases the inflammation, growth and pain associated with the disease. However, the relationship between estrogen and endometriosis is complex since the absence of estrogen does not always mean the absence of endometriosis."

Early treatment can slow or halt the natural progression of the disease and reduce the long-term symptoms.In addition to talking to their doctor, people may find additional advice and emotional assistance in local patient support groups.\nSome treatments are associated with side effects, and endometriosis-related symptoms can sometimes reappear after therapy ends. The choice of treatment depends on effectiveness in the individual, adverse side effects, long-term safety, costs, and availability. Most current hormonal management is not suitable for persons suffering from endometriosis who wish to get pregnant, since they affect ovulation.Success in reducing pain symptoms and increasing pregnancy rates through surgery are often dependent on the extent of disease.

It is considered a symptom of an underlying condition(s).\nAnaemia may be caused by several factors: nutrient deficiencies, inadequate diet (or the inadequate absorption of nutrients), infections, inflammation, chronic diseases, gynaecological and obstetric conditions, and inherited red blood cell disorders.\nIron deficiency, primarily due to inadequate dietary iron intake, is considered the most common nutritional deficiency leading to anaemia. Deficiencies in vitamin A, folate, vitamin B12 and riboflavin can also result in anaemia due to their specific roles in the synthesis of haemoglobin and/or erythrocyte production. Additional mechanisms include nutrient losses (e.g. blood loss from parasitic infections, haemorrhage associated with childbirth, or menstrual loss), impaired absorption, low iron stores at birth, and nutrient interactions affecting iron bioavailability.\nInfections can be another important cause of anaemia, depending on the local burden of infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and parasitic infections. Infections can impair nutrient absorption and metabolism (e.g. malaria, ascariasis) or can cause nutrient loss (e.g. schistosomiasis, hookworm infection). Many different chronic conditions can cause inflammation and lead to anaemia of inflammation or anaemia of chronic disease. HIV infection causes anaemia through a wide range of mechanisms including ineffective production or excessive destruction of red blood cells, blood loss, and side effects of the drug treatment.\nConsistent heavy menstrual losses, maternal blood volume expansion during pregnancy, and blood loss during and after childbirth, particularly in cases of postpartum haemorrhage, commonly lead to anaemia.\nAdditionally, in some regions, inherited red blood cell disorders are a common cause of anaemia. These include conditions such as \u03b1- and \u03b2-thalassemia due to abnormalities of haemoglobin synthesis, sickle cell disorders due to changes in the haemoglobin structure, other haemoglobinopathies due to haemoglobin gene variants, abnormalities of red cell enzymes, or abnormalities of the red blood cell membrane."

The vast majority of these deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. Unsafe sanitation accounts for 564 000 of these deaths, largely from diarrhoeal disease, and it is a major factor in several neglected tropical diseases, including intestinal worms, schistosomiasis and trachoma. Poor sanitation also contributes to malnutrition.\nDiarrhoea remains a major killer but is largely preventable. Better water, sanitation, and hygiene could prevent the deaths among children aged under 5 years, 395\u00a0000 in the year 2019.\nOpen defecation perpetuates a vicious cycle of disease and poverty. The countries where open defection is most widespread have the highest number of deaths of children aged under 5 years as well as the highest levels of malnutrition and poverty, and big disparities of wealth."

To achieve universal safely managed services, rates would need to increase five-fold.\nThe situation in urban areas, particularly in dense, low income and informal areas, is a growing challenge as sewerage is precarious or non-existent, space for toilets is at a premium, poorly designed and managed pits and septic tanks contaminate open drains and groundwater and services for faecal sludge removal are unavailable or unaffordable. Inequalities are compounded when sewage discharged into storm drains and waterways pollutes poorer low-lowing areas of cities. The effects of climate change \u2013 floods, water scarcity and droughts, and sea level rise \u2013 is setting back progress for the billions of people without safely managed services and threatens to undermine existing services if they are not made more resilient.\nWastewater and sludge are increasingly seen as a valuable resource in the circular economy that can provide reliable water and nutrients for food production and recovered energy in various forms. In fact, use of wastewater and sludge is already commonplace, but much is used unsafely without adequate treatment, controls on use or regulatory oversight. Safe use that prevents transmission of excreta-related disease is vital to reduce harms and maximize beneficial use of wastewater and sludge.\nIn 2019 UN-Water launched the SDG6 global acceleration framework (GAF). On World Toilet Day 2020, WHO and UNICEF launched theState of the world\u2019s sanitationreport laying out the scale of the challenge in terms of health impact, sanitation coverage, progress, policy and investment and also laying out an acceleration agenda for sanitation under the GAF."

Since 2000, the largest increase in deaths has been for this disease, rising by 2.7 million to 9.1 million deaths in 2021. As a newly emerged cause of deaths, COVID-19 was directly responsible for 8.8 million deaths in 2021, and consequently, largely pushed down other leading causes of death by one place. Instead of being the second and third leading causes of death as in 2019, stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease became the third and fourth in 2021, responsible for approximately 10% and 5% of total deaths, respectively.\nLower respiratory infections remained the world\u2019s most deadly communicable disease other than COVID-19, ranked as the fifth leading cause of death. However, the number of deaths has gone down substantially: in 2021 it claimed 2.5 million lives, 370 000 fewer than in 2000.\nDeaths from other noncommunicable diseases were also on the rise. Trachea, bronchus and lung cancers deaths have risen from 1.2 million in 2000 to 1.9 million in 2021 and are now ranked sixth among leading causes of death.\nIn 2021, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia ranked as the seventh leading cause of death, killing 1.8 million lives. Women are disproportionately affected. Globally, 68% of deaths from Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia are women.\nDiabetes was also among the top 10 causes of death, following a significant percentage increase of 95% since 2000.\nOther diseases which were among the top 10 causes of death in 2000 are no longer on the list. HIV and AIDS are among them. Deaths from HIV and AIDS have fallen by 61%, moving from the world\u2019s seventh leading cause of death in 2000 to the twenty-first in 2021. Similarly, deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases have dropped by 45%, from sixth leading cause of death in 2000 to thirteenth in 2021.\nIn contrast, kidney diseases have risen from the world\u2019s nineteenth leading cause of death to the ninth, with number of deaths increasing by 95% between 2000 and 2021."

Despite the global decline, 8 of the top 10 causes of death in 2021 in low-income countries were communicable diseases.\nMalaria, tuberculosis and HIV and AIDS all remain in the top 10. However, they all fell significantly. The biggest decrease among the top 10 deaths in this group has been for HIV and AIDS, with 63% fewer deaths in 2021 than in 2000.\nDiarrhoeal diseases are also a significant cause of death in low-income countries: they ranked seventh leading causes of death for this income category in 2021. Nonetheless, diarrhoeal diseases are decreasing, representing the third biggest decrease in fatalities among the top 10 (in low-income countries, falling 38% in 2000 and 2021).\nDeaths due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are particularly infrequent in low-income countries compared to other income groups. It does not appear in the top 10 for low-income countries yet ranks in the top 10 for all other income groups.\nWhile the top killer in low-income countries was lower respiratory infections in 2021, COVID-19 ranked only the sixth, the lowest ranking of the diseases among all income groupings, killing a total of 258 000 people.\nLower-middle-income countries have the most balanced top 10 causes of death: 5 noncommunicable, and 5 communicable, with the new cause COVID-19 topping the list and costing over 4 million lives in 2021. Diabetes is a rising cause of death in this income group: it has moved from the fourteenth to eighth leading cause of death and the number of deaths from this disease has more than doubled since 2000.\nAs a top 10 cause of death in this income group, tuberculosis and diarrhoeal diseases remain a significant challenge. However, these categories of disease saw substantial decreases in absolute deaths, both falling by about 47% between 2000 and 2021. The biggest increase in absolute deaths is from ischaemic heart disease, rising by more than 1.4 million since 2000 to 3.2 million in 2021. HIV and AIDS have seen the biggest decrease in rank among the previous top 10 causes of death in 2000, moving from seventh to nineteenth.\nIn upper-middle-income countries, there has been a notable rise in deaths from lung cancer, which have increased by 442 000; more than 2.5 times the increase in deaths of all three other income groups combined. In addition, stomach cancer features highly in upper-middle-income countries compared to the other income groups, remaining the only group with this disease in the top 10 causes of death.\nDeaths from ischaemic heart disease have increased by more than 1.4 million, the second largest rise in any income group in terms of absolute number of deaths from this cause, just 40 000 lower than the increase in lower-middle-income countries. In 2021, ischaemic heart disease ranked second, closely tracking stroke in total absolute number of deaths and one place ahead of COVID-19.\nOther than COVID-19, there is only one communicable disease (lower respiratory infections) in the top 10 causes of death for upper-middle-income countries. It ranked eighth in 2021, down by 3 places since 2000.\nIn high-income countries, deaths are increasing for the majority of the top 10 diseases in 2000, primarily due to population ageing. Exceptionally, schaemic heart disease, stroke and stomach cancer are among the causes of death in the top 10 for which the total numbers have gone down between 2000 and 2021 \u2013 by 15%, 18% and 19%, respectively. High-income is the only category of income group in which there have been decreasing numbers of deaths from these three diseases. Nonetheless ischaemic heart disease and stroke have remained in the top three causes of death for this income category, with a combined total of over 2.6 million fatalities in 2021. In addition, deaths from hypertensive heart disease are rising. Reflecting a global trend, this disease has more than doubled and risen from the sixteenth leading cause of death in 2000 to the tenth in 2021.\nDeaths due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementias have also increased dramatically, nearly four-fold since 2000. This became the fourth leading cause of death in high-income countries and is on track to overtake stroke as one of the top three.\nCOVID-19 claimed 1.2 million lives and ranked second in 2021 in high-income countries. As with upper-middle-income countries, only one other communicable disease \u2013 lower respiratory infections \u2013 appears in the top 10 causes of death."

Plague bacillus,Y. pestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a \u2018bubo\u2019. At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with pus. Human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare. Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more severe type of plague called pneumonic plague.Pneumonicplague, or lung-based plague, is the most virulent form of plague. Incubation can be as short as 24 hours. Any person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to other humans.

The care providers should be aware of the risk and should have immediate access to clean water or medically prepared saline water prior to starting the treatment. Use the following guidance when providing care to a person who has been exposed to white phosphorous:\nCare should be taken not to expose others when removing phosphorus particles. Since white phosphorus can spontaneously ignite, care should be taken to prevent exposure to all sources of ignition such as naked flames, electrical equipment, and the smoking of tobacco products.Remove the patient from exposure, then carefully remove the patient\u2019s clothes and personal effects. Bear in mind that contaminated clothing can ignite or reignite; therefore, contaminated items should be placed in a water-filled closable container that is clearly labelled as a hazard. Rinse and irrigate the skin with cool water and keep exposed areas wet to stop ignition, e.g. by covering with wet cloths, during transportation to the treatment unit.Exposed skin and wounds should be continuously irrigated (flushed) with cool saline or water, or immersed in water, while phosphorus particles are being removed. Irrigation of affected areas can stop combustion, lower the temperature of burnt areas, and dilute any phosphoric acid that may have formed in the wound. It is important to use cool rather than warm water. In warm water the phosphorus may more easily reach the autoignition temperature; moreover, the phosphorus may melt, making it more difficult to see. Care should be taken to avoid contamination to unexposed skin.Remove fragments of molten white phosphorus only with forceps, never with the hands, even if protected with surgical gloves.Removed phosphorus should be submerged in cold water to prevent ignition. Embedded white phosphorus particles may be difficult to see but can be visualized using ultraviolet light.Further management depends on the severity of the burns and should be guided by a burn specialist.If the eyes have been exposed to white phosphorus or smoke from white phosphorus use, first irrigate the eye with plenty of water or 0.9% saline for 10\u201315 minutes (remove contact lenses if this can be done easily). Use of a topical local anaesthetic will reduce blepharospasm and assist irrigation; however, irrigation should not be delayed if the anaesthetic is not immediately available.If there are particles of phosphorus in the eye evert the eyelids and remove the particles while continuing to irrigate. Place removed particles under water in a container. Give a full eye examination and refer urgently to an ophthalmologist if there is evidence of injury."

Neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before surgery) can help reduce tumour size, making it more manageable for surgical removal. Adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) is very often recommended after surgery to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. In cases where surgery is not feasible, radiation therapy or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may be used as the primary treatment. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy may also be considered based on specific tumour characteristics. Individualized treatment plans should be discussed with healthcare professionals.\nb) Advanced disease:The treatment for metastatic stage lung cancer, where the cancer has spread to distant organs or lymph nodes, is based on various factors, including the patient's overall health, the extent and location of metastases, histology, genetic profile, and individual preferences. The primary goal is to prolong survival, alleviate symptoms, and improve quality of life.Systemic therapies, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, play a crucial role in the treatment of metastatic lung cancer.\nChemotherapy is often the first-line treatment for the majority of patients around the world and involves the use of drugs that circulate throughout the body to kill cancer cells. Combination chemotherapy regimens are commonly used, and the choice of drugs depends on factors such as the histological type of the cancer and the patient's general health conditions. Targeted therapy, designed to block the signalling pathways that drive the growth of cancer cells, is an important option for patients with specific genetic mutations or biomarkers identified in their tumour. Immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors, has revolutionized the treatment of metastatic lung cancer. These drugs help to stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Local treatments, such as radiation therapy and surgery, may be used to manage specific metastatic sites or alleviate symptoms caused by tumour growth."

Censuses and surveys can be used to estimate population numbers, but these are not designed to capture information on all causes of death. Some countries have set up sample registration systems that can generate nationally representative mortality data.\nIn the absence of medical certification of causes of death, the WHO standard verbal autopsy questionnaires can be used to generate population-level cause-of-death statistics.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the important use of mortality data. The analysis of excess mortality, which is the extra number of deaths compared to what would be expected in normal times, revealed the true impact of the pandemic. Excess mortality includes deaths resulting directly from COVID-19 and those indirectly related to it, for example when over-stretched healthcare systems struggle to provide care to patients during the pandemic.

The WHOCRVS Strategic Implementation Plan 2021\u20132025is based on four strategic objectives to accelerate CRVS system strengthening in Member States through more effective engagement and leadership by the health sector. Moreover, by virtue of its reach and proximity to the population it serves, the health sector is ideally placed to support the registration of births and deaths where laws permit. WHO, in collaboration with UNICEF, has publishedguidance on the health sector contributionstowards improving the civil registration of births and deaths in low-income countries.\nWHO sets the norms and standards for the generation of cause-of-death statistics to ensure comparability across countries. For more than a century, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has been the basis for comparable statistics on causes of mortality and morbidity between places and over time. Originating in the 19th century, the latest version,ICD-11, was adopted by the 72ndWorld Health Assembly in 2019 and came into effect on 1 January 2022.\nStrengthening CRVS systems requires collaboration with partners to align investment and avoid duplication of efforts. TheHealth Data Collaborativehas set up a CRVS technical group to support coordinated country-level engagement. The three levels of WHO (headquarters, regional and country offices) coordinate technical support to countries. WHO also supports regional initiatives led by development partners to promote CRVS in the global agenda.\nIn order to monitor and improve global health, WHO has set up the WHO Mortality Database since 1950 with the aim to gather information about deaths and causes of death. With data from more than 120 countries\u2019 CRVS systems, theWHO Mortality Databaseis the premier data source for international comparative epidemiological studies of mortality by cause. It has underpinned global policies to improve population health such as reduction in tobacco smoking, prevention of mortality from road traffic accidents and noncommunicable diseases.\nBy monitoring the global availability and quality of cause-of-death data, WHO can identify gaps in systems, resources and support that need to be prioritized to improve health situations.\nInformation on births, deaths and causes of deaths is an integral part of a country\u2019s health information system. Health professionals use the information to plan for health services and monitor the effectiveness of their interventions. In this regard, theSCORE for Health Data Technical Packagewas developed by WHO and partners to assist Member States in strengthening country data systems and capacity to monitor progress towards the health-related SDGs, universal health care, and other national and subnational health priorities and targets.\nThe SCORE for Health Data Technical Package converges comprehensive strategies and interventions for strengthening country health information systems. Launched in August 2020, the report is a concrete starting point to improve the availability of timely, reliable and comparable health data to track progress towards the Triple Billion targets and health-related Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe C in SCORE stands for Count, which is to count births, deaths and causes of deaths, including the full birth and death registration and certification and report on causes of death. The SCORE assessment has enabled countries to look at the maturity of their CRVS systems, identify gaps and moved CRVS to the top of their priorities.\nReferences"

In areas where the disease is endemic, affected individuals, even children, typically know whether they have tungiasis.\u00a0Most affected individuals attempt to extract the fleas, leaving a typical circular lesion, often with the blackened remains of the dead flea. This is a clear indication of recent infection.\nThe acute and chronic morbidity associated with tungiasis results from an inflammatory reaction around embedded female sand fleas, exacerbated by bacterial superinfection. During the acute phase, erythema, oedema, desquamation, pain and itching are constant. Itching induces scratching of the lesion, which in turn facilitates bacterial superinfection. Abscesses, sometimes large, are common.\nThe feet are the most common infection point but infestation can occur in all parts of the body. Bullous-type lesions have also been reported. Fissures, ulcers, lymphangitis, lymphoedema, ascending neuritis, deformation and loss of nails, and tissue necrosis are chronic complications. These result in pain, disability, disfigurement and mutilation of the feet, causing characteristic changes in the way people with tungiasis walk."

The toes, sole, lateral rim of the foot and heel are common sites of infection, and 99% of all lesions occur on the feet.\nIn some areas, several mammalian species have been found to act as reservoirs for human infection. In rural areas, these are predominantly pigs and bovines; in resource-poor urban communities, they are found in dogs, cats and rats.

Embedded parasites are removed under non-sterile conditions using instruments such as sticks, hair pins, thorns, safety pins, sewing needles or scissors. The procedure is painful and traumatizes children. Removing the fleas can cause local inflammation if the parasite ruptures and introduces pathogenic bacteria, leading to further superinfection of the sore. The instrument is often subsequently used on several people, which risks transmission of diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or even HIV.\nMechanical extraction should only be performed with surgical instruments by an experienced nurse under sterile conditions. After removal of sand fleas, the wound must be dressed appropriately and the tetanus vaccination status verified and a booster vaccination given, if indicated.\nTopical treatment with a formula of two dimeticone oils with low viscosity (NYDA\u00ae) is highly effective and safe."

The spontaneous disintegration of atoms is called radioactivity, and the excess energy emitted is a form of ionizing radiation. Unstable elements which disintegrate and emit ionizing radiation are called radionuclides.\nThe activity \u2014 used as a measure of the amount of a radionuclide present \u2014 is expressed in a unit called the becquerel (Bq): one becquerel is one disintegration per second. The half-life is the time required for the activity of a radionuclide to decrease by decay to half of its initial value. The half-life of a radioactive element is the time that it takes for one half of its atoms to disintegrate. This can range from a mere fraction of a second to millions of years (e.g. iodine-131 has a half-life of 8 days while carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 years)."

Radon, a naturally-occurring gas, emanates from rock and soil and is the main source of natural radiation. Every day, people inhale and ingest radionuclides from air, food and water.\nPeople are also exposed to natural radiation from cosmic rays, particularly at high altitude. On average, 80% of the annual dose of background radiation that a person receives is due to naturally occurring terrestrial and cosmic radiation sources. Background radiation levels vary geographically due to geological differences. Exposure in certain areas can be more than 200 times higher than the global average.\nExposure to radiation also comes from human-made sources ranging from nuclear power generation to medical uses of radiation for diagnosis or treatment. Today, the most common human-made sources of ionizing radiation are medical devices, including x-ray machines and Computed Tomography (CT) scanners."

        "content": "Exposure to radiation may occur through internal or external pathways.\nInternal exposure to ionizing radiation occurs when a radionuclide is inhaled, ingested or otherwise enters into the bloodstream (for example, by injection or through wounds). Internal exposure stops when the radionuclide is eliminated from the body, either spontaneously (such as through excreta) or as a result of a treatment.\nExposure to ionizing radiation can be classified for radiation protection purposes into three exposure situations, i.e. planned, existing and emergency situations. Planned exposure situations result from the deliberate introduction and operation of radiation sources with specific purposes, as is the case with the medical use of radiation for diagnosis or treatment of patients, or the use of radiation in industry or research. Existing exposure occurs where radiation already exists and a decision on control must be taken \u2013 for example, exposure to radon in homes or workplaces or exposure to natural background radiation from the environment. Emergency exposure situations result from unexpected events requiring prompt response, such as nuclear accidents or malicious acts.\nMedical use of radiation accounts for 98 % of the population dose contribution from all human-made sources, and represents 20% of the total population exposure. Annually worldwide, more than 4200 million diagnostic radiology examinations are performed, 40 million nuclear medicine procedures are carried out, and 8.5 million radiotherapy treatments are given."

        "content": "Radiation damage to tissue and/or organs depends on the dose of radiation received, or the absorbed dose which is expressed in a unit called the gray (Gy). The potential damage from an absorbed dose depends on the type of radiation and the sensitivity of the different tissues and organs.\nThe effective dose\u00a0 is used to measure ionizing radiation in terms of the potential for causing harm. The sievert (Sv) is the unit of effective dose that takes into account the type of radiation and sensitivity of tissues and organs. It is a way to measure ionizing radiation in terms of the potential for causing harm. In addition to the amount of radiation (dose), the rate at which the dose is delivered (dose rate), described in microsieverts per hour (\u03bcSv/hour) or millisievert per year (mSv/year), is an important parameter.\nBeyond certain thresholds, radiation can impair the functioning of tissues and/or organs and can produce acute effects such as skin redness, hair loss, radiation burns, or acute radiation syndrome. These effects are more severe at higher doses and higher dose rates. For instance, the dose threshold for acute radiation syndrome is about 1 Sv (1000 mSv).\nIf the radiation dose is low and/or it is delivered over a long period of time (low dose rate), the risk is substantially low because there is a greater likelihood of repairing the damage. There is still a risk of long-term effects such as cataract or cancer, however, that may appear years or even decades later. Effects of this type will not always occur, but their likelihood is proportional to the radiation dose. This risk is higher for children and adolescents as they are significantly more sensitive to radiation exposure than adults.\nEpidemiological studies on populations exposed to radiation, such as the survivors of the atomic bombings or radiotherapy patients, showed a significant increase of cancer risk at doses above 100 mSv. More recently, some epidemiological studies in individuals exposed to medical exposure during childhood (paediatric CT) have suggested that cancer risk may increase even at lower doses (between 50-100 mSv).\nPrenatal exposure to ionizing radiation may induce brain damage in foetuses following an acute dose exceeding 100 mSv between weeks 8-15 of pregnancy and 200 mSv between weeks 16-25 of pregnancy. Before week 8 or after week 25 of pregnancy human studies have not shown radiation risk to fetal brain development. Epidemiological studies indicate that the cancer risk after fetal exposure to radiation is similar to the risk after exposure in early childhood."

Bacterial pathogens includeEscherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Campylobacter spp., while parasitic pathogens includeCryptosporidium,Giardia, andEntamoeba spp. Rotavirus andE. coliare the most common pathogens among children across all age groups, while parasitic pathogens, are prevalent in children aged 3\u20135 years. Bacterial pathogens, includingE. coli,Salmonella, andShigella, were common in the children age 6 to 10-year age group, as were rotavirus, norovirus, and sapovirus. Location-specific etiologic patterns also need to be considered.\nMalnutrition:Children who die from diarrhoea often suffer from underlying malnutrition, which makes them more vulnerable to diarrhoea. Each diarrhoeal episode, in turn, makes their malnutrition even worse. Diarrhoea is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under 5 years old.\nSource:Water contaminated with human faeces, for example from sewage, septic tanks and latrines, is of particular concern. Animal faeces also contain microorganisms that can cause diarrhoea.\nOther causes:Diarrhoeal disease can also spread from person-to-person, aggravated by poor personal hygiene.

Monkey bites are associated with rabies, simian retroviruses, herpes B virus, andmpoxinfections, as well as bacterial infections related to salmonella and campylobacter species.\nBat bites:Bats are a reservoir for rabies virus worldwide and their bites might not leave recognizable marks making it challenging to determine the risk of exposure. While there are no worldwide estimates on bat bites, bats are the leading cause of rabies deaths in the United States. In Latin America, the risk of bites from hematophagous bats poses the risk of rabies for humans.\nRodent and other wildlife bites:Rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and ferrets are commonly associated with bite injuries. Rabies is relatively rare in domestic rodents; however, the bite injuries may lead to bacterial infections of leptospira, salmonella species and hantavirus infections.\nBites by raccoons, skunks, and foxes are often associated with rabies exposure in the United States. While injuries to vital organs are to be cautious of, bites by birds are rarely associated with life-threatening infections.\nCat bites:Female adults have the highest rate of cat bites. However, similar to dog bites, cat bites are particularly more serious in children with injuries to the face, neck and head.\nMonkey bites:Monkey bites are an important risk among travellers, after dog bites. Occupational and recreational exposures to monkey bites are related to animal control, veterinary, zoologist, wildlife professions, and hunting or trapping animals.\nBat bites:People are often exposed to bat bites because of occupational or recreational activities that involve regular handling of bats such as animal control and wildlife workers, veterinary staff and zoologists.

Dental caries develops when bacteria in the mouth metabolize sugars to produce acid that demineralizes the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel and dentine).\nIn many countries, sugars-sweetened beverages, including fruit-based and milk-based sweetened drinks and 100% fruit juices, are a primary source of free sugars, as well as confectionery, cakes, biscuits, sweetened cereals, sweet desserts, sucrose, honey, syrups and preserves.\nLimiting free sugars intake to less than 10% of total energy intake \u2013 and ideally even further, to less than 5% \u2013 minimizes the risk of dental caries throughout the lifecourse.\nSevere dental caries is a frequent cause of absenteeism at school or work. An association between dental caries and undernutrition in children has been reported in some low- and middle-income countries; however, whether this is cause or effect, or both, remains to be determined."

Because dental caries is the result of lifelong exposure to a dietary risk factor (i.e. free sugars), even a small reduction in the risk of dental caries in childhood is of significance in later life; therefore, to minimize the lifelong risk of dental caries, free sugars intake should be as low as possible.\nIt is important that population-wide prevention interventions are universally available and accessible. Such interventions include the use of fluoride and comprehensive patient-centred essential oral health care."

The focus of interventions is generally characterized by an isolated disease approach and a focus on costly clinical treatment, rather than on integrated cost-effective public health strategies that address entire populations and focus on common risk factors for NCDs.\nEconomic growth is associated with increased access to sugar-sweetened beverages and other dietary sources of free sugars.

If you live with someone who has either type of meningitis, you should:\ntalk to your doctor or nurse about taking antibiotics (in case of bacterial meningitis)wash hands frequently, especially before eatingavoid close contact and sharing cups, utensils or toothbrushes.\nLicensed vaccines against meningococcal, pneumococcal andHaemophilus influenzaedisease have been available for many years. These bacteria have several different strains (known as serotypes or serogroups) and vaccines are designed to protect against the most harmful strains. No universal vaccine exists.\nHib vaccine is used in most national childhood immunization programmes globally. WHO also recommends universal use pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV).Meningococcal vaccinesinclude multivalent polysaccharide conjugate vaccines (MMCV), which include 4 to 5 meningococcal serogroups (A,C,W,Y,X); protein-based vaccines, which include meningococcal serogroup B, and combination vaccines combining the latter with 4-valent MMCV. Polysaccharide vaccines are still marketed internationally but are gradually being replaced by MMCV.\nIn the African meningitis belt, meningococcus serogroup A accounted for 80\u201385% of meningitis epidemics before the large-scale deployment of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine starting in 2010. In 2023, the first pentavalent MMCV protecting against serogroups A, C, W, Y and X (Men5CV) was prequalified by WHO and recommended for use in countries of the African meningitis belt. Roll-out of Men5CV has the potential to eliminate meningitis epidemics and make the meningitis belt history.\nPost-exposure prophylaxis with antibiotics is given to close contacts of individuals with meningococcal disease to eradicate asymptomatic meningococcal carriage in the nose and decrease the risk of transmission.\nIdentifying mothers whose babies are at risk of getting Group B streptococcal (GBS) disease is recommended in many countries.

Interventions can be designed for individuals, specific groups or whole populations.\nReshaping the determinants of mental health often requires action beyond the health sector and so promotion and prevention programmes should involve the education, labour, justice, transport, environment, housing, and welfare sectors. The health sector can contribute significantly by embedding promotion and prevention efforts within health services; and by advocating, initiating and, where appropriate, facilitating multisectoral collaboration and coordination.\nSuicide prevention is a global priority and included in the Sustainable Development Goals. Much progress can be achieved by limiting access to means, responsible media reporting, social and emotional learning for adolescents and early intervention. Banning highly hazardous pesticides is a particularly inexpensive and cost\u2013effective intervention for reducing suicide rates.\nPromoting child and adolescent mental health is another priority and can be achieved by policies and laws that promote and protect mental health, supporting caregivers to provide nurturing care, implementing school-based programmes and improving the quality of community and online environments. School-based social and emotional learning programmes are among the most effective promotion strategies for countries at all income levels.\nPromoting and protecting mental health at work is a growing area of interest and can be supported through legislation and regulation, organizational strategies, manager training and interventions for workers."

These workers often operate in unsafe working environments, work long hours, have little or no access to social or financial\r\n    protections and face discrimination, all of which can undermine mental health.\nAlthough psychosocial risks can be found in all sectors, some workers are more likely to be exposed to them than others, because of what they do or where and how they work. Health, humanitarian or emergency workers often have jobs that carry an elevated\r\n    risk of exposure to adverse events, which can negatively impact mental health.\nEconomic recessions or humanitarian and public health emergencies elicit risks such as job loss, financial instability, reduced employment opportunities or increased unemployment.\nWork can be a setting which amplifies wider issues that negatively affect mental health, including discrimination and inequality based on factors such as, race, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, social origin, migrant status, religion\r\n    or age.\nPeople with severe mental health conditions are more likely to be excluded from employment, and when in employment, they are more likely to experience inequality at work.

        "content": "Transport systems should be responsive to the needs of users and forgiving of human error. The safe system approach to road safety aims to ensure a safe transport system for all road users. This approach takes into account people\u2019s vulnerability to serious injuries and recognizes that the system should be designed to accommodate human error. The cornerstones of this approach are safe roads and roadsides, safe speeds, safe vehicles, and safe road users, all of which must be addressed in order to eliminate fatal crashes and reduce serious injuries.\nAn increase in average speed is      directly related both to the likelihood of a crash occurring and to the      severity of the consequences of the crash. For example, every 1% increase      in mean speed produces a 4% increase in the fatal crash risk and a 3%      increase in the serious crash risk.The risk of death for      pedestrians hit by car fronts rises rapidly (4.5 times from 50 km/h to 65      km/h).In car-to-car side impacts the      fatality risk for car occupants is 85% at 65 km/h.\nDriving under the influence of      alcohol and any psychoactive substance or drug increases the risk of a      crash that results in death or serious injuries.In the case of drink-driving,      the risk of a road traffic crash starts at low levels of blood alcohol      concentration (BAC) and increases significantly when the driver's BAC is \u2265      0.04 g/dl.In the case of drug-driving,      the risk of incurring a road traffic crash is increased to differing      degrees depending on the psychoactive drug used. For example, the risk of      a fatal crash occurring among those who have used amphetamines is about 5      times the risk of someone who hasn't.\nCorrect helmet use can reduce      the risk of death in a crash by more than 6 times and the risk of brain injury      by up to 74%.Wearing a seat-belt can reduce      the risk of death among vehicle occupants by up to 50%.The use of child restraints can      lead to a 71% reduction in deaths among infants.\nThere are many types of distractions that can lead to impaired driving. The distraction caused by mobile phones is a growing concern for road safety.\nDrivers using mobile phones are      approximately 4 times more likely to be involved in a crash than drivers      not using a mobile phone. Using a phone while driving slows reaction times      (notably braking reaction time, but also reaction to traffic signals), and      makes it difficult to keep in the correct lane, and to keep the correct      following distances.Hands-free phones are not much      safer than hand-held phone sets. Texting considerably increases the risk      of a crash.\nThe design of roads can have a considerable impact on their safety. Ideally, roads should be designed keeping in mind the safety of all road users. This would mean making sure that there are adequate facilities for pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Measures such as footpaths, cycling lanes, safe crossing points and other traffic calming measures can be critical to reducing the risk of injury among these road users.\nSafe vehicles play a critical role in averting crashes and reducing the likelihood of serious injury. There are a number of UN regulations on vehicle safety that, if applied to countries\u2019 manufacturing and production standards, would potentially save many lives. These include requiring vehicle manufacturers to meet front and side impact regulations, to include electronic stability control (to prevent over-steering) and to ensure airbags and seat-belts are fitted in all vehicles. Without these basic standards the risk of traffic injuries \u2013 both to those in the vehicle and those out of it \u2013 is considerably increased.\nDelays in detecting and providing care for those involved in a road traffic crash increase the severity of injuries. Care of injuries after a crash has occurred is extremely time-sensitive: delays of minutes can make the difference between life and death. Improving post-crash care requires ensuring access to timely prehospital care, and improving the quality of both prehospital and hospital care, such as through specialist training programmes.\nIf traffic laws on drink-driving, seat-belt wearing, speed limits, helmets and child restraints are not enforced, they cannot bring about the expected reduction in road traffic fatalities and injuries related to specific behaviours. Thus, if traffic laws are not enforced or are perceived as not being enforced, it is likely they will not be complied with and therefore will have very little chance of influencing behaviour.\nEffective enforcement includes establishing, regularly updating, and enforcing laws at the national, municipal, and local levels that address the above mentioned risk factors. It includes also the definition of appropriate penalties."

Infection becomes less frequent and shorter in duration with increasing age. Infection is usually acquired when living in close proximity to others with active disease, and the family is the main setting for transmission. An individual\u2019s immune system can clear a single episode of infection, but in endemic communities re-acquisition of the organism occurs frequently.\nAfter years of repeated infection, the inside of the eyelid can become so severely scarred (trachomatous conjunctival scarring) that it turns inwards and causes the eyelashes to rub against the eyeball (trachomatous trichiasis), resulting in constant pain and light intolerance. This and other alterations of the eye can lead to scarring of the cornea. Left untreated, this condition leads to the formation of irreversible opacities, with resulting visual impairment or blindness. The age at which this occurs depends on several factors including local transmission intensity. In very highly endemic communities it can occur in childhood, though onset of visual impairment between the ages of 30 and 40 years is more typical.\nVisual impairment or blindness results in a worsening of the life experience of affected individuals and their families, who are normally already amongst the poorest of the poor. Women are blinded up to 4 times as often as men, probably due to their close contact with infected children and their resulting greater frequency of infection episodes.\nEnvironmental factors associated with more intense transmission ofC. trachomatisinclude:\ninadequate hygienecrowded householdsinadequate access to waterinadequate access to and use of sanitation."

As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines become ineffective and infections become difficult or impossible to treat, increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, disability and death.\nAMR is a natural process that happens over time through genetic changes in pathogens. Its emergence and spread is accelerated by human activity, mainly the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials to treat, prevent or control infections in humans, animals and plants."

For example, it creates need for more expensive and intensive care, affects productivity of patients or their caregivers through prolonged hospital stays, and harms agricultural productivity.\nAMR is a problem for all countries at all income levels. Its spread does not recognize country borders. Contributing factors include lack of access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) for both humans and animals; poor infection and disease prevention and control in homes, healthcare facilities and farms;\u00a0poor access to quality and affordable vaccines, diagnostics and medicines; lack of awareness and knowledge; and lack of enforcement of relevant legislation.\u00a0People living in low-resource settings and vulnerable populations are especially impacted by both the drivers and consequences of AMR."

        "content": "The global rise in antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat, diminishing the efficacy of common antibiotics against widespread bacterial infections. The2022 Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) reporthighlights alarming resistance rates among prevalent bacterial pathogens.\u00a0 Median reported rates in 76 countries of 42% for third-generation cephalosporin-resistantE. coliand 35% for methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureusare a major concern. For urinary tract infections caused byE. coli, 1\u00a0in\u00a05 cases exhibited reduced susceptibility to standard antibiotics like ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and fluoroquinolones in 2020. This is making it harder to effectively treat common infections.\nKlebsiella pneumoniae, a common intestinal bacterium, also showed elevated resistance levels against critical antibiotics. Increased levels of resistance potentially lead to heightened utilization of last-resort drugs like carbapenems, for which resistance is in turn being observed across multiple regions. As the effectiveness of these last-resort drugs is compromised, the risks increase of infections that cannot be treated. Projections by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicate an anticipated twofold surge in resistance to last-resort antibiotics by 2035, compared to 2005 levels, underscoring the urgent need for robust antimicrobial stewardship practices and enhanced surveillance coverage worldwide.\nAs drug-resistant fungal infections increase, WHO is monitoring their magnitude and public health impact. Fungal infections can be difficult to treat, including due to drug-drug interactions for patients with other infections (e.g. HIV). The emergence and spread of multi-drug resistantCandida auris, an invasive fungal infection, is of particular concern. Development ofWHO\u2019s Fungal Priority Pathogens List(see below) included a comprehensive review of fungal infections and drug-resistant fungi globally.\nHIV drug resistance (HIVDR) is caused by changes in the HIV genome that affect the ability of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to block the replication of the virus. HIVDR can either be transmitted at the time of infection or acquired because of inadequate adherence to treatment or drug-drug interactions. HIVDR can lead to increased HIV infections and HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. WHO recommends that countries routinely implement HIVDR surveys to inform the selection of optimal ARV drug regimens for HIV prevention and treatment.\nTuberculosis (TB) is a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most effective first-line TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using second-line drugs, but these medicines are expensive and toxic, and in some cases more extensive drug resistance can develop. TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective second-line TB drugs can leave patients with very limited treatment options. MDR-TB is therefore a public health crisis and threat to health security. Only about 2\u00a0in\u00a05 people with drug resistant TB accessed treatment in 2022.\nThe emergence of drug-resistant parasites is a major threat to malaria control. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicatedPlasmodium falciparummalaria and are used by most malaria endemic countries. Emergence of partial resistance to artemisinin and/or partner drugs in ACTs makes selecting the right treatment more challenging and requires close monitoring. In the Greater Mekong Subregion, partial resistance to artemisinin or a partner drug has been confirmed in several countries since 2001. In the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, resistance to a partner drug, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, led in some countries to treatment failure requiring a change to another ACT. In Africa, mutations linked to artemisinin partial resistance have been observed in several countries. ACTs that have been tested remain efficacious, but further spread of resistance could be a major public health challenge and improved surveillance is vital.\nThe emergence of drug resistance against medicines for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is a significant threat to programmes to control, eliminate and eradicate NTDs, which especially affect vulnerable and marginalized populations. Resistance has been reported in leprosy medicines (dapsone, rifampicine and clofazimine) in several countries, in several anti-helminthics (while resistance has so far only been observed in use in animals, which is a serious concern for the veterinary sector, some of these medicines are also used in humans), in medicines used to treat human African trypanosomiasis (melarsoprol) and leishmaniasis (pentavalent antimonials, miltefosine), and others. \u00a0It is important to monitor resistance and drug efficacy, put in place strategies to delay or curb resistance, and strengthen the pipeline of second-line medicines for NTDs. For example, WHO provides guidance for surveillance of resistance for the global leprosy elimination programme, and support to control distribution and monitor the standardized use, safety and efficacy of medicines, including donated medicines, in NTD programmes."

        "content": "AMR is a complex problem that requires both sector-specific actions in the human health, food production, animal and environmental sectors, and a coordinated approach across these sectors. One Health refers to an integrated, unifying approach that aims to achieve optimal and sustainable health outcomes for people, animals and ecosystems. It recognizes that the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants and the wider environment are closely linked and inter-dependent. The One Health approach to preventing and controlling AMR brings together stakeholders from relevant sectors to communicate and work together in the design, implementation and monitoring of\u00a0programmes, policies, legislation and research to mitigate AMR and attain better health and economic outcomes.\nTo address AMR globally, countries adopted theGlobal Action Plan\u00a0(GAP) on AMRduring the 2015 World Health Assembly and committed to the development and implementation of multisectoral national action plans with a One Health approach to tackle AMR. The GAP was subsequently endorsed by the Governing Bodies of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH, formerly known as OIE) and the United Nations Environment Program.\nTo coordinate the One Health global response to AMR, WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). The 4 organizations (FAO, UNEP, WHO and WOAH) are known as the Quadripartite. A quadripartite joint secretariat is hosted by WHO to drive multi-stakeholder engagement in AMR. This has supported establishment of theGlobal Leaders Group on AMR, which began its work in November 2020, and theMulti-Stakeholder Partnership Platform, which was launched in November 2022, and several technical working groups.\nIn March 2022, United Nations General Assembly resolution A/RES/76/257 established a second High-level Meeting on AMR to be held in 2024, in collaboration with the Quadripartite Organizations and with the support of the Global Leaders Group. In October 2023, The President of the General Assembly appointed the Permanent Representatives of Barbados and Malta to co-facilitate the high-level meeting. The high-level meeting is an important opportunity for countries to make ambitious commitments and agree targets, and the Quadripartite Joint Secretariat is working closely with the co-facilitators and Global Leaders Group to ensure optimal participation and inputs from the human, animal, agri-food and the environment sectors.\nIn addition, three Global High-level Ministerial Conferences on AMR, in the Netherlands in 2014 and 2019, and in Oman in 2022, led to the Global Action Plan, theAMR Multi-Partner Trust Fund, and groundbreaking multisectoral AMR targets. A fourth high-level ministerial conference will be hosted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2024.\nWorld AMR Awareness Week (WAAW)is a global campaign to raise awareness, understanding and best practices with the public, One Health stakeholders, and other policymakers. One of WHO\u2019s official health campaigns since 2015, WAAW is celebrated from 18\u00a0to\u00a024 November every year."

        "content": "As of November 2023, 178 countries had developed AMR national action plans aligned with the GAP. To ensure sustained progress, countries need to establish a functioning multisectoral AMR governance mechanism, prioritize activities, develop a costed operational plan, mobilize resources (both domestic and external), and effectively implement their plan. Monitoring mechanisms are needed to track progress, identify challenges and report periodically. To globally track the progress in AMR national action plan implementation, countries have committed to completing the multisectoral annual Tracking AMR Country Self-Assessment Survey (TrACSS) that was launched in 2016 with results published athttps://www.amrcountryprogress.org/.\nTo address AMR in a programmatic manner that puts people, their needs and equitable access to health services at the centre of the AMR response in the community, in primary care, secondary and tertiary care, and at national and/or subnational level, WHO has developed thePeople-centred approach to addressing antimicrobial resistance in human healthand WHO core package of interventions to support national action plans. This focuses on preventing infections and ensuring universal access to health services for quality diagnosis and appropriate treatment. As a crucial part of their AMR response, countries can integrate the core package of AMR interventions in national plans and strategies for universal health coverage and health emergency preparedness and response.\nAntimicrobial stewardship is a systematic approach to educate and support health care professionals to follow evidence-based guidelines for prescribing and administering antimicrobials. The education of the health workforce is of crucial importance, as they form the front line in safeguarding the effectiveness of antimicrobial medicines. WHO guides countries to develop and implement Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes as one of the most cost-effective interventions to optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines, improve patient outcomes and reduce AMR and health care-associated infections.\nTo improve access to appropriate treatment and reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics, WHO developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification of antibiotics. TheWHO AWaRe antibiotic bookprovides concise, evidence-based guidance on the choice of antibiotic, dose, route of administration, and duration of treatment for more than 30 of the most common clinical infections in children and adults in both primary health care and hospital settings.\nWHO launched theGlobal Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS)in 2015 to fill knowledge gaps and inform strategies at all levels. GLASS progressively incorporates data from surveillance of AMR in humans, surveillance of the use and consumption of antimicrobials, and integrated AMR data in the One Health sectors including the food chain and in the environment.\nGLASS provides a standardized approach to the collection, analysis, interpretation and sharing of data by countries, territories and areas. It also monitors the status of existing and new national surveillance systems, with emphasis on representativeness and quality of data collection.\u00a0Some WHO regions have established surveillance networks that provide technical support to countries and facilitate enrollment into GLASS.\nWHO is committed especially to supporting low- and middle-income countries to improve data collection and usage for policymaking, both through GLASS and by supportingnationally representative AMR prevalence surveys.\nThe clinical pipeline of new antimicrobials is almost dry and there is a pipeline and access crisis for antibiotics.WHO\u2019s latest annual review of the pre-clinical and clinical antibacterial pipelinesidentified 27 antibiotics in clinical development that address WHO bacterial priority pathogens, of which only 6 were classified as innovative. In addition, a lack of access to quality antimicrobials and shortages of generic off-patent antibiotics affect countries across all levels of income and development.\nTo guide research and development into new antimicrobials, diagnostics and vaccines, and inform public health action, WHO developed the firstWHO bacterial priority pathogens listin 2017 and updated this in 2023 (publication forthcoming), and published the WHOfungal priority pathogen listin 2022.\nTo help fill the major gaps in R&D for antimicrobials, vaccines and diagnostic tools, WHO works closely with organizations such as the Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership (GARDP), the AMR Action Fund, and the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X). Various governments are also piloting different models to incentivize research and development of newer antimicrobials to ultimately ensure access to treatment.\nGreater innovation and investment are also required in epidemiological and operational research. WHO has outlined40 priority research topics for AMR in human healthand, with the Quadripartite organizations, aOne Health priority research agenda for AMR.\nReferences\n1.

Inorganic arsenic is naturally present at high levels in the groundwater of a number of countries, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Chile, China, India, Mexico, Pakistan, the United States of America and Viet Nam. Drinking-water, crops irrigated with contaminated water and food prepared with contaminated water are the sources of exposure.\nFish, shellfish, meat, poultry, dairy products and cereals can also be dietary sources of arsenic, although exposure from these foods is generally much lower compared to exposure through contaminated groundwater. In seafood, arsenic is mainly found in its less toxic organic form.\nIndustrial processes\nArsenic is used industrially as an alloying agent, as well as in the processing of glass, pigments, textiles, paper, metal adhesives, wood preservatives and ammunition. Arsenic is also used in the hide tanning process and, to a limited extent, in pesticides, feed additives and pharmaceuticals.\nTobacco\nPeople who smoke tobacco can also be exposed to the natural inorganic arsenic content of tobacco because tobacco plants can take up arsenic naturally present in the soil. The potential for elevated arsenic exposure was much greater in the past when tobacco plants were treated with lead arsenate insecticide."

Inorganic arsenic compounds (such as those found in water) are highly toxic while organic arsenic compounds (such as those found in seafood) are less harmful to health.\nAcute effects\nThe immediate symptoms of acute arsenic poisoning include vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. These are followed by numbness and tingling of the extremities, muscle cramping and death, in extreme cases.\nLong-term effects\nThe first symptoms of long-term exposure to high levels of inorganic arsenic (for example, through drinking-water and food) are usually observed in the skin, and include pigmentation changes, skin lesions and hard patches on the palms and soles of the feet (hyperkeratosis). These occur after a minimum exposure of approximately five years and may be a precursor to skin cancer.\nIn addition to skin cancer, long-term exposure to arsenic may also cause cancers of the bladder and lungs. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified arsenic and arsenic compounds as carcinogenic to humans and has also stated that arsenic in drinking-water is carcinogenic to humans.\nOther adverse health effects that may be associated with long-term ingestion of inorganic arsenic include developmental effects, diabetes, pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease. Arsenic-induced myocardial infarction in particular can be a significant cause of excess mortality.\nArsenic is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant mortality, with impacts on child health(1), and exposure in utero and in early childhood has been linked to increases in mortality in young adults due to multiple cancers, lung disease, heart attacks and kidney failure(2).

An estimated 140 million people in at least 70 countries have been drinking water containing arsenic at levels above the WHO provisional guideline value of 10 \u03bcg/L(4, 5). This is consistent with recent statistical modelling which suggests between 94 and 220 million people are at risk of exposure to elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater(6).\nThe symptoms and signs caused by long-term elevated exposure to inorganic arsenic differ between individuals, population groups and geographical areas. Thus, there is no universal definition of the disease caused by arsenic. This complicates the assessment of the burden on health of arsenic.\nSimilarly, there is no method to distinguish cases of cancer caused by arsenic from cancers induced by other factors. As a result, there is no reliable estimate of the magnitude of the problem worldwide.\nIn 2010, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) re-evaluated the effects of arsenic on human health, taking new data into account. JECFA concluded that for certain regions of the world where concentrations of inorganic arsenic in drinking-water exceed 50\u2013100 \u03bcg/L, there is some evidence of adverse effects. In other areas, where arsenic concentrations in water are elevated (10\u201350 \u03bcg/L), JECFA concluded that while there is a possibility of adverse effects.

There are a number of options to reduce levels of arsenic in drinking-water.\nSubstitute high-arsenic      sources, such as groundwater, with low-arsenic, microbiologically safe      sources such as rainwater and treated surface water. Low-arsenic water can      be used for drinking, cooking and irrigation purposes, whereas      high-arsenic water can be used for other purposes such as bathing and      washing clothes.Discriminate between      high-arsenic and low-arsenic sources. For example, test water for arsenic      levels and paint tube wells or hand pumps different colours. This can be      an effective and low-cost means to rapidly reduce exposure to arsenic when      accompanied by effective education.Blend low-arsenic water with      higher-arsenic water to achieve an acceptable arsenic concentration level.Install arsenic removal systems      \u2013 either centralized or domestic \u2013 and ensure the appropriate disposal of      the removed arsenic.

WHO\u2019s work to reduce arsenic exposure includes setting guideline values, reviewing evidence and providing risk management recommendations. WHO publishes a guideline value for arsenic in itsGuidelines for drinking-water quality. The Guidelines are intended for use as the basis for regulation and standard setting worldwide.\nThe current recommended limit of arsenic in drinking-water is 10 \u03bcg/L, although this guideline value is designated as provisional because of practical difficulties in removing arsenic from drinking-water. Every effort should therefore be made to keep concentrations as low as reasonably possible and below the guideline value when resources are available.\nHowever, millions of people around the world are exposed to arsenic at concentrations much higher than the guideline value (100 \u03bcg/L or greater), and therefore the public health priority should be to reduce exposure for these people. Where it is difficult to achieve the guideline value, Member States may set higher limits or interim values as part of an overall strategy to progressively reduce risks, while taking into account local circumstances, available resources, and risks from low arsenic sources that are contaminated microbiologically.\nThe WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene monitors progress towards global targets on drinking water.

Immunosuppression can be considered as a risk factor for cancer and can cause reactivation of viruses (e.g. cold sores in the lip).\nChronic effects on skin and lips from UVR exposure include:\ncutaneous melanoma: a life-threatening malignant skin cancer;squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): a malignant cancer, which generally spreads less than melanoma and is less likely to cause death;basal cell carcinoma (BCC): a slow-growing skin cancer appearing predominantly in older people; andpremature skin aging: a loss of skin elasticity at a young age with decreased wound healing.\nExcessive exposure to UVR caused around 1.2 million new cases of non-melanoma skin cancers (SCC and BCC) and 325 000 melanomas of the skin, and 64 000 premature deaths from non-melanoma and 57 000 melanomas of the skin in the year 2020.\nAcute effects of UVR include photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis (inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva, respectively). These effects are reversible, easily prevented by protective eyewear and are not usually associated with any long-term damage but are painful and might require therapeutic intervention.\nChronic effects of UVR include:\ncataract (an eye disease where the lens becomes increasingly opaque, resulting in impaired vision and eventual blindness);pterygium (growth of fleshy tissue which can cover part of the cornea); andcancer in and around the eye (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma).\nUV exposure may also be involved in the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\nWorldwide, it is estimated that 15 million people are blind due to cataracts; of these, some 10% may be due to exposure to UVR.\nUVR in small amounts is essential to good health as it leads to the production of vitamin D in the body.

The higher the UVI value, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eye, and the less time it takes for harm to occur. Sun protection measures should be used when the UVI reaches 3 or above."

The risk of being physically punished is similar for boys and girls, and for children from wealthy and poor households.\nEvidence shows corporal punishment increases children\u2019s behavioural problems over time and has no positive outcomes.\nAll corporal punishment, however mild or light, carries an inbuilt risk of escalation. Studies suggest that parents who used corporal punishment are at heightened risk of perpetrating severe maltreatment.\nCorporal punishment is linked to a range of negative outcomes for children across countries and cultures, including physical and mental ill-health, impaired cognitive and socio-emotional development, poor educational outcomes, increased aggression and perpetration of violence.\nCorporal punishment is a violation of children\u2019s rights to respect for physical integrity and human dignity, health, development, education and freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\nThe elimination of violence against children is called for in several targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development but most explicitly in Target 16.2: \u201cend abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children\u201d.\nCorporal punishment and the associated harms are preventable through multisectoral and multifaceted approaches, including law reform, changing harmful norms around child rearing and punishment, parent and caregiver support, and school-based programming."

On average, 17% of children experienced severe physical punishment (being hit on the head, face or ears or hit hard and repeatedly) but in some countries this figure exceeds 40%. Large variations across countries and regions show the potential for prevention.\nApart from some countries where rates among boys are higher, results from comparable surveys show that the prevalence of corporal punishment is similar for girls and boys. Young children (aged 2\u20134 years) are as likely, and in some countries more likely, as older children (aged 5\u201314 years) to be exposed to physical punishment, including harsh forms. Physical disciplinary methods are used even with very young children \u2013 comparable surveys conducted in 29 countries 2012\u20132016 show that 3 in 10 children aged 12\u201323 months are subjected to spanking.\nMost children are exposed to both psychological and physical means of punishment. Many parents and caregivers report using non-violent disciplines measures (such as explaining why the child\u2019s behaviour was wrong, taking away privileges) but these are usually used in combination with violent methods. Children who experience only non-violent forms of discipline are in the minority.\nOne in 2 children aged 6\u201317 years (732\u00a0million) live in countries where corporal punishment at school is not fully prohibited. Studies have shown that lifetime prevalence of school corporal punishment was above 70% in Africa and Central America, past-year prevalence was above 60% in the WHO Regions of Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia, and past-week prevalence was above 40% in Africa and South-East Asia. Lower rates were found in the WHO Western Pacific Region, with lifetime and past year prevalence around 25%.

Children not only experience pain, sadness, fear, anger, shame and guilt, but feeling threatened also leads to physiological stress and the activation of neural pathways that support dealing with danger. Children who have been physically punished tend to exhibit high hormonal reactivity to stress, overloaded biological systems, including the nervous, cardiovascular and nutritional systems, and changes in brain structure and function.\nDespite its widespread acceptability, spanking is also linked to atypical brain function like that of more severe abuse, thereby undermining the frequently cited argument that less severe forms of physical punishment are not harmful.\nA large body of research\u00a0shows links between corporal punishment and a wide range of negative outcomes, both immediate and long-term:\ndirect physical harm, sometimes resulting in severe damage, long-term disability or death;mental ill-health, including behavioural and anxiety disorders, depression, hopelessness, low self-esteem, self-harm and suicide attempts, alcohol and drug dependency, hostility and emotional instability, which continue into adulthood;impaired cognitive and socio-emotional development, specifically emotion regulation and conflict solving skills;damage to education, including school dropout and lower academic and occupational success;poor moral internalization and increased antisocial behaviour;increased aggression in children;adult perpetration of violent, antisocial and criminal behaviour;indirect physical harm due to overloaded biological systems, including developing cancer, alcohol-related problems, migraine, cardiovascular disease, arthritis and obesity that continue into adulthood;increased acceptance and use of other forms of violence; anddamaged family relationships.\nThere is some evidence of a dose\u2013response relationship, with studies finding that the association with child aggression and lower achievement in mathematics and reading ability became stronger as the frequency of corporal punishment increased."

SCI results in complete or incomplete loss of sensory and/or motor functions below injury level. In paraplegia arm functions are preserved; in tetraplegia they are affected. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction affecting diverse functions can occur at any level of injury.\nInappropriate management of SCI related impairments and secondary conditions often causes premature mortality.\nSCI can diminish the capacity to perform daily activities, including walking, using one\u2019s hands, physiological emptying of bowel/bladder or washing and dressing oneself. Limitations are compounded by misconceptions, negative attitudes and physical barriers to basic mobility, restricting independence and full societal participation. SCI is a major cause of long-term disability, accounting for over 4.5 million years of life lived with disability (YLDs) in 2021.\nImportantly, many restrictions in performing activities and participating in meaningful life areas do not result from the condition itself, but from insufficient or inadequate medical care, rehabilitation and assistive technologies access, a high economic burden, and from barriers in the physical, social and policy environments. For example, globally, only 5\u201335% have wheelchair access."

People with SCI often die earlier because of health system factors such as insufficient access to or poor quality health services. For people with SCI, the in\u2011hospital mortality rate is nearly three times higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.\nMisconceptions, negative attitudes and mobility barriers prevent many individuals from full societal participation. Children with SCI are less likely than their peers to start school, and once enrolled, less likely to advance. Adults with SCI face similar barriers to economic participation, with unemployment rates exceeding 60%.\nMany people with SCI, their carers and families face substantial social and economic consequences. While existing data limit global cost estimates of SCI, its economic burden is significant.

Other forms include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (abnormal deposits of protein inside nerve cells), and a group of diseases that contribute to frontotemporal dementia (degeneration of the frontal lobe of the brain). Dementia may also develop after a stroke or in the context of certain infections such as HIV, as a result of harmful use of alcohol, repetitive physical injuries to the brain (known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy) or nutritional deficiencies. The boundaries between different forms of dementia are indistinct and mixed forms often co-exist."

Risk assessments of food additives are conducted by an independent, international expert scientific group \u2013 the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).\nOnly food additives that have undergone a JECFA safety assessment and are found not to present an appreciable health risk to consumers can be used internationally. This applies whether food additives come from natural sources or they are synthetic. National authorities, either based on the JECFA assessment or a national assessment, can then authorize the use of food additives at specified levels for specific foods.\nJECFA evaluations are based on scientific reviews of all available biochemical, toxicological, and other relevant data on a given additive \u2013 mandatory tests in animals, research studies and observations in humans are considered. The toxicological tests required by JECFA include acute, short-term and long-term studies that determine how the food additive is absorbed, distributed and excreted, and possible harmful effects of the additive or its by-products at certain exposure levels.\nThe starting point for determining whether a food additive can be used without having harmful effects is to establish the acceptable daily intake (ADI). The ADI is an estimate of the amount of an additive in food or drinking water that can be safely consumed daily over a lifetime without adverse health effects.\nThe safety assessments completed by JECFA are used by the joint intergovernmental food standard-setting body of FAO and WHO, the Codex Alimentarius Commission, to establish levels for maximum use of additives in food and drinks. Codex standards are the reference for national standards for consumer protection, and for the international trade in food, so that consumers everywhere can be confident that the food they eat meets the agreed standards for safety and quality, no matter where it was produced.\nOnce a food additive has been found to be safe for use by JECFA and maximum use levels have been established in the Codex General Standard for Food Additives, national food regulations need to be implemented permitting the actual use of a food additive.\nThe Codex Alimentarius Commission also establishes standards and guidelines on food labelling. These standards are implemented in most countries, and food manufacturers are obliged to indicate which additives are in their products. In the European Union, for example, there is legislation governing labelling of food additives according to a set of pre-defined E-numbers. People who have allergies or sensitivities to certain food additives should check labels carefully.\nWHO encourages national authorities to monitor and ensure that food additives in food and drinks produced in their countries comply with permitted uses, conditions and legislation. National authorities should oversee the food business, which carries the primary responsibility for ensuring that the use of a food additive is safe and complies with legislation."

Also, the risk of developing NCDs is lowered by:\nreducing saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy intake;reducingtrans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake; andreplacing both saturated fats andtrans-fats with unsaturated fats(2, 3)\u2013 in particular, with polyunsaturated fats.\nFat intake, especially saturated fat and industrially-producedtrans-fat intake, can be reduced by:\nsteaming or boiling instead of frying when cooking;replacing butter, lard and ghee with oils rich in polyunsaturated fats, such as soybean, canola (rapeseed), corn, safflower and sunflower oils;eating reduced-fat dairy foods and lean meats, or trimming visible fat from meat; andlimiting the consumption of baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods (e.g. doughnuts, cakes, pies, cookies, biscuits and wafers) that contain industrially-producedtrans-fats.\nMost people consume too much sodium through salt (corresponding to consuming an average of 9\u201312\u00a0g of salt per day) and not enough potassium (less than 3.5\u00a0g). High sodium intake and insufficient potassium intake contribute to high\r\n        blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke(8, 11).\nReducing salt intake to the recommended level of less than 5 g per day could prevent 1.7\u00a0million deaths each year(12).\nPeople are often unaware of the amount of salt they consume. In many countries, most salt \u00a0comes from processed foods (e.g. ready meals; processed meats such as bacon, ham and salami; cheese; and salty snacks) or from foods consumed frequently\r\n        in large amounts (e.g. bread). Salt is also added to foods during cooking (e.g. bouillon, stock cubes, soy sauce and fish sauce) or at the point of consumption (e.g. table salt).\nSalt intake can be reduced by:\nlimiting the amount of salt and high-sodium condiments (e.g. soy sauce, fish sauce and bouillon) when cooking and preparing foods;not having salt or high-sodium sauces on the table;limiting the consumption of salty snacks; andchoosing products with lower sodium content.\nSome food manufacturers are reformulating recipes to reduce the sodium content of their products, and people should be encouraged to check nutrition labels to see how much sodium is in a product before purchasing or consuming it.\nPotassium can mitigate the negative effects of elevated sodium consumption on blood pressure. Intake of potassium can be increased by consuming fresh fruit and vegetables.\nIn both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake(2, 7). \u00a0A reduction to less than 5% of total energy intake would provide additional health benefits(7).\nConsuming free sugars increases the risk of dental caries (tooth decay). Excess calories from foods and drinks high in free sugars also contribute to unhealthy weight gain, which can lead to overweight and obesity. Recent evidence also shows that\r\n        free sugars influence blood pressure and serum lipids, and suggests that a reduction in free sugars intake reduces risk factors for cardiovascular diseases(13).\nSugars intake can be reduced by:\nlimiting the consumption of foods and drinks containing high amounts of sugars, such as sugary snacks, candies and sugar-sweetened beverages (i.e. all types of beverages containing free sugars \u2013 these include carbonated or non\u2010carbonated\r\n            soft drinks, fruit or vegetable juices and drinks, liquid and powder concentrates, flavoured water, energy and sports drinks, ready\u2010to\u2010drink tea, ready\u2010to\u2010drink coffee and flavoured milk drinks); andeating fresh fruit and raw vegetables as snacks instead of sugary snacks."

Among other dietary factors, high intake of trans fat increases the risk of death from any cause by 34%, coronary heart disease deaths by 28%, and coronary heart disease by 21%. Trans fat has no known health benefits.\nTrans fat is produced industrially by the partial hydrogenation of any liquid oils, in most cases vegetable oils, but also occurs naturally in meat and dairy products from ruminant animals. For a healthy diet, the recommended intake of trans-fats is less than 1% of total energy. Industrially produced trans fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided.\nGovernments have a central role in creating healthy food environments that enable people to adopt and maintain healthy dietary practices and must encourage reformulation of food products to reduce trans fat, with the goal of eliminating industrially produced trans fat. WHO developed a REPLACE action package that supports governments to design and implement a policy to eliminate industrially produced trans fat from their food supply."

On average, trans fat concentrations in PHO are 25\u201345%. Naturally occurring trans fats come from ruminants (such as cows and sheep), are found in meat and dairy foods, and are equally harmful as industrially produced trans fat.\nFrying oil at high temperatures leads to modest increases in trans fat concentrations. However, this amount of trans fat generated is low (up to 2\u20133 %) when compared with the amount of trans fat in PHO."

Experiences in several countries demonstrate that industrially produced trans fat can be replaced by healthier oils. Costs of implementing best practice interventions (i.e. regulatory limits on trans fat) are well under the commonly accepted thresholds of cost-effectiveness. Thus, WHO recommends trans fat elimination as a cost-effective intervention for low- and middle-income countries. Governments can eliminate the cause of 7% of cardiovascular disease globally with a low-cost investment.\nExperiences in several countries demonstrate that mandatory approaches are much more effective than voluntary approaches to reducing trans fat in the food supply and in the population.\nWHO recommends the following two best-practice alternatives:\n1) mandatory national limit of 2 grams of industrially produced trans fat per 100 grams of total fat in all foods; and\n2) mandatory national ban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated oils (a major source of trans fat) as an ingredient in all foods.\nPHO in foods can be replaced by oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), followed by oils rich in monounsaturated fatty-acids (MUFA). Oils rich in PUFA include those from safflower, corn, sunflower, soybean, fatty fishes, walnuts and seeds; oils rich in MUFA include canola, olive, peanut, and oils from nuts and avocados. The choices of fats and oils used in many countries will be influenced by availability, cost of alternatives and the oil industry\u2019s capacity to innovate."

Menopause can also be a consequence of surgical or medical procedures.Menopause is caused by the loss of ovarian follicular function and a decline in circulating blood oestrogen levels.The menopausal transition can be gradual, usually beginning with changes in the menstrual cycle. Perimenopause refers to the period from when these signs are first observed and ends one year after the final menstrual period.Perimenopause can last several years and can affect physical, emotional, mental and social well-being.A variety of non-hormonal and hormonal interventions can help alleviate perimenopausal symptoms."

This means that the ovaries stop releasing eggs for fertilization.\nThe regularity and length of the menstrual cycle varies across a woman\u2019s reproductive life span, but the age at which natural menopause occurs is generally between 45 and 55 years for women worldwide.\nNatural menopause is deemed to have occurred after 12 consecutive months without menstruation for which there is no other obvious physiological or pathological cause and in the absence of clinical intervention.\nSome women experience menopause earlier (before 40 years of age). This premature menopause may be because of certain chromosomal abnormalities, autoimmune disorders or other unknown causes.\nIt is not possible to predict when an individual woman will experience menopause, although there are associations between the age at menopause and certain demographic, health and genetic factors.\nMenopause can also be induced as a consequence of surgical procedures that involve removal of both ovaries or medical interventions that cause cessation of ovarian function (for example radiation therapy or chemotherapy).\nMany women have already stopped menstruating before menopause, for example those who have had certain surgical procedures (hysterectomy or surgical removal of their uterine lining) as well as those using certain hormonal contraceptives and other medicines that cause infrequent or absent periods.

The symptoms experienced during and following the menopausal transition vary substantially from person to person. Some have few if any symptoms. For others, symptoms can be severe and affect daily activities and quality of life. Some can experience symptoms for several years.\nSymptoms associated with menopause include:\nhot flushes and night sweats. Hot flushes refer to a sudden feeling of heat in the face, neck and chest, often accompanied by flushing of the skin, perspiration (sweating), palpitations and acute feelings of physical discomfort which can last several minutes;changes in the regularity and flow of the menstrual cycle, culminating in cessation of menstruation;vaginal dryness, pain during sexual intercourse and incontinence;difficulty sleeping/insomnia; andchanges in mood, depression and anxiety.\nBody composition and cardiovascular risk can also be affected. Women\u2019s advantage over men in terms of cardiovascular disease gradually disappears with the significant decline in oestrogen levels after menopause. Menopause can also result in the weakening of the pelvic support structures, increasing the risk of pelvic organ prolapse. Loss of bone density at menopause is a significant contributor to higher rates of osteoporosis and fractures.\nThere are a variety of non-hormonal and hormonal interventions that can help alleviate symptoms of menopause. Symptoms that impact on health and well-being should be discussed with a health-care provider to identify available management options, with consideration of medical history, values, and preferences.\nPregnancy is still possible during perimenopause. Contraception is recommended to avoid unintended pregnancy until after 12 consecutive months without menstruation. Pregnancy after menopause is unlikely without fertility treatment that involves the use of donor eggs or previously frozen embryos.\nDuring perimenopause and following menopause, it is still possible to acquire sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, through unprotected sexual contact, including oral, anal and vaginal sex. The thinning of the vaginal wall after menopause increases the chances of lesions and tears, thereby increasing the risk of HIV transmission during vaginal sex."

Therefore, perimenopausal care plays an important role in the promotion of healthy ageing and quality of life.\nMenopause can be an important transition from a social perspective, as well as a biological one. Socially, a women\u2019s experience of menopause may be influenced by gender norms, familial and sociocultural factors, including how female ageing and the menopausal transition are viewed in her culture.\nThe global population of postmenopausal women is growing. In 2021, women aged 50 and over accounted for 26% of all women and girls globally. This was up from 22% 10 years earlier(1). Additionally, women are living longer.

Menopause currently receives limited attention in the training curricula for many health-care workers.\nThe sexual well-being of menopausal women is overlooked in many countries. This means that common gynaecological effects of menopause, including vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse, may go unaddressed. Similarly, older women may not consider themselves at risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV(3), or may not be counselled by their providers to practice safer sex or get tested.\nMany governments do not have health polices and financing for the inclusion of menopause-related diagnosis, counselling, and treatment services as part of their routinely available services.

People and certain animals, such as dogs or cats swallow these infected water fleas mostly by drinking contaminated water or by consuming raw or undercooked aquatic hosts harbouring the infective larvae. Although the water fleas die in the stomach, the released larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate through the body until a fertilized female, measuring 60\u2013100\u202fcm, settles beneath the skin.

Past instances of re-emergence in Ethiopia (2008) and Chad (2010), after both had reported zero cases for prolonged intervals, highlight why continuous vigilance is critical. If a country reports zero cases for 14\u202fmonths, it is considered to have interrupted transmission but remains in the pre-certification phase for a minimum of three additional years.

Physical, emotional and social changes, including exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, can make adolescents vulnerable to mental health problems. Protecting adolescents from adversity, promoting socio-emotional learning and psychological well-being, and ensuring access to mental health care are critical for their health and well-being during adolescence and adulthood.\nGlobally, it is estimated that one in seven (14%) of 10\u201319-year-olds experience mental health conditions(1), yet these remain largely unrecognized and untreated.\nAdolescents with mental health conditions are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion, discrimination, stigma (affecting readiness to seek help), educational difficulties, risk-taking behaviours, physical ill-health and human rights violations."

These include adopting healthy sleep patterns; exercising regularly; developing coping, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills; and learning to manage emotions. Protective and supportive environments in the family, at school and in the wider community are important.\nMultiple factors affect mental health. The more risk factors adolescents are exposed to, the greater the potential impact on their mental health. Factors that can contribute to stress during adolescence include exposure to adversity, pressure to conform with peers and exploration of identity. Media influence and gender norms can exacerbate the disparity between an adolescent\u2019s lived reality and their perceptions or aspirations for the future. Other important determinants include the quality of their home life and relationships with peers. Violence (especially sexual violence and bullying), harsh parenting and severe and socioeconomic problems are recognized risks to mental health.\nSome adolescents are at greater risk of mental health conditions due to their living conditions, stigma, discrimination or exclusion, or lack of access to quality support and services. These include adolescents living in humanitarian and fragile settings; adolescents with chronic illness, autism spectrum disorder, an intellectual disability or other neurological condition; pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents, or those in early or forced marriages; orphans; and adolescents from minority ethnic or sexual backgrounds or other discriminated groups."

Contaminated water or ice is also a source of infection. A proportion of cases occur following contact with contaminated water during recreational activities.\nCampylobacteriosis is a zoonosis, a disease transmitted to humans from animals or animal products. Most often, carcasses or meat are contaminated byCampylobacterfrom faeces during slaughtering. In animals,Campylobacterseldom causes disease.\nThe relative contribution of each of the above sources to the overall burden of disease is unclear but consumption of undercooked contaminated poultry is believed to be a major contributor. Since common-source outbreaks account for a rather small proportion of cases, the vast majority of reports refer to sporadic cases, with no easily discernible pattern.\nEstimating the importance of all known sources is therefore extremely difficult. In addition, the wide occurrence ofCampylobacteralso hinders the development of control strategies throughout the food chain.

First, in many societies, girls are under pressure to marry and bear children.As of 2021, the estimated global number of child brides was 650 million: child marriage places girls at increased risk of pregnancy because girls who are married very early typically have limited autonomy to influence decision-making about delaying child-bearing and contraceptive use. Second, in many places, girls choose to become pregnant because they have limited educational and employment prospects and motherhood is valued.\nContraceptives are not easily accessible to adolescents in many places. Even when adolescents can obtain contraceptives, they may lack the agency or the resources to pay for them, knowledge on where to obtain them and how to correctly use them. They may face stigma when trying to obtain contraceptives. Further, they are often at higher risk of discontinuing use due to side effects, and due to changing life circumstances and reproductive intentions.Restrictive laws and policies regarding the provision of contraceptives based on age or marital status pose an important barrier to the provision and uptake of contraceptives among adolescents. This is often combined with health worker bias and/or lack of willingness to acknowledge adolescents\u2019 sexual health needs.\nChild sexual abuse increases the risk of unintended pregnancies. AWHO report published in 2021estimates that 120 million girls aged under 20 years were subjected to sexual violence by someone other than a partner. This abuse is deeply rooted in gender inequality; it affects more girls than boys, although many boys are also affected. Estimates suggest that in 2020, at least 1 in 8 of the world\u2019s children had been sexually abused before reaching the age of 18, and 1 in 20 girls aged 15\u201319 years had experienced forced sex during their lifetime.\nThe WHO report titledViolence against women prevalence estimates 2018notes that \u201cadolescents aged 15\u201319 years (24%) are estimated to have already been subjected to physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner at least once in their lifetime, and 16% of adolescent girls and young women aged 15\u201319 have been subjected to this violence within the past 12 months.\u201d\nPreventing adolescent pregnancy and childbearing as well as child marriage is part of the SDG agenda with dedicated indicators, including indicator 3.7.2, \u201cAdolescent birth rate (aged 10\u201314 years; aged 15\u201319 years) per 1000 women in that age group,\u201d and 5.3.1, \u201cProportion of women aged 20\u201324 years married before the age of 18 years.\u201d\nStrategies and interventions related to adolescent pregnancy have focused on pregnancy prevention. However, there is growing attention being paid to improving access to and quality of maternal care for pregnant and parenting adolescents. Available data on access paints a mixed picture. Access to quality care depends on the geographic context and the social status of adolescents. Even where access is not limited, adolescents appear to receive a lower quality of both clinical care and interpersonal support than adult women do."

It is an intoxication usually caused by ingestion of potent neurotoxins, the botulinum toxins, formed in contaminated foods. Person to person transmission of botulism does not occur.\nSpores produced by the bacteriaClostridium botulinumare heat-resistant and exist widely in the environment, and in the absence of oxygen they germinate, grow and then excrete toxins. There are 7 distinct forms of botulinum toxin, types A\u2013G. Four of these (types A, B, E and rarely F) cause human botulism. Types C, D and E cause illness in other mammals, birds and fish.\nBotulinum toxins are ingested through improperly processed food in which the bacteria or the spores survive, then grow and produce the toxins. Though mainly a foodborne intoxication, human botulism can also be caused by intestinal infection withC. botulinumin infants, wound infections, and by inhalation."

        "heading": "Symptoms of foodborne botulism",
        "content": "Botulinum toxins are neurotoxic and therefore affect the nervous system. Foodborne botulism is characterized by descending, flaccid paralysis that can cause respiratory failure. Early symptoms include marked fatigue, weakness and vertigo, usually followed by blurred vision, dry mouth and difficulty in swallowing and speaking. Vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal swelling may also occur. The disease can progress to weakness in the neck and arms, after which the respiratory muscles and muscles of the lower body are affected. There is no fever and no loss of consciousness.\nThe symptoms are not caused by the bacterium itself, but by the toxin produced by the bacterium. Symptoms usually appear within 12 to 36 hours (within a minimum and maximum range of 4 hours to 8 days) after exposure. Incidence of botulism is low, but the mortality rate is high if prompt diagnosis and appropriate, immediate treatment (early administration of antitoxin and intensive respiratory care) are not given. The disease can be fatal in 5 to 10% of cases."

        "content": "C. botulinumis an anaerobic bacterium, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. Foodborne botulism occurs whenC. botulinumgrows and produces toxins in food prior to consumption.C. botulinumproduces spores and they exist widely in the environment including soil, river and sea water.\nThe growth of the bacteria and the formation of toxin occur in products with low oxygen content and certain combinations of storage temperature and preservative parameters. This happens most often in lightly preserved foods and in inadequately processed, home-canned or home-bottled foods.\nC. botulinumwill not grow in acidic conditions (pH less than 4.6), and therefore the toxin will not be formed in acidic foods (however, a low pH will not degrade any pre-formed toxin). Combinations of low storage temperature and salt contents and/or pH are also used to prevent the growth of the bacteria or the formation of the toxin.\nThe botulinum toxin has been found in a variety of foods, including low-acid preserved vegetables, such as green beans, spinach, mushrooms, and beets; fish, including canned tuna, fermented, salted and smoked fish; and meat products, such as ham and sausage. The food implicated differs between countries and reflects local eating habits and food preservation procedures. Occasionally, commercially prepared foods are involved.\nThough spores ofC. botulinumare heat-resistant, the toxin produced by bacteria growing out of the spores under anaerobic conditions is destroyed by boiling (for example, at internal temperature greater than 85 \u00b0C for 5 minutes or longer). Therefore, ready-to-eat foods in low oxygen-packaging are more frequently involved in cases of foodborne botulism.\nFood samples associated with suspect cases must be obtained immediately, stored in properly sealed containers, and sent to laboratories in order to identify the cause and to prevent further cases.\nInfant botulism occurs mostly in infants under 6 months of age. Different from foodborne botulism caused by ingestion of pre-formed toxins in food, it occurs when infants ingestC. botulinumspores, which germinate into bacteria that colonize in the gut and release toxins. In most adults and children older than about 6 months, this would not happen because natural defences in intestines that develop over time prevent germination and growth of the bacterium.\nC. botulinumin infants include constipation, loss of appetite, weakness, an altered cry and a striking loss of head control. Although there are several possible sources of infection for infant botulism, spore-contaminated honey has been associated with a number of cases. Parents and caregivers are therefore warned not to feed honey to the infants before the age of 1 year.\nWound botulism is rare and occurs when the spores get into an open wound and are able to reproduce in an anaerobic environment. The symptoms are similar to the foodborne botulism, but may take up to 2 weeks to appear. This form of the disease has been associated with substance abuse, particularly when injecting black tar heroin.\nInhalation botulism is rare and does not occur naturally, for example it is associated with accidental or intentional events (such as bioterrorism) which result in release of the toxins in aerosols. Inhalation botulism exhibits a similar clinical footprint to foodborne botulism. The median lethal dose for humans has been estimated at 2 nanograms of botulinum toxin per kilogram of bodyweight, which is approximately 3 times greater than in foodborne cases.\nFollowing inhalation of the toxin, symptoms become visible between 1\u20133 days, with longer onset times for lower levels of intoxication. Symptoms proceed in a similar manner to ingestion of botulinum toxin and culminate in muscular paralysis and respiratory failure.\nIf exposure to the toxin via aerosol inhalation is suspected, additional exposure to the patient and others must be prevented. The patient's clothing must be removed and stored in plastic bags until it can be washed thoroughly with soap and water. The patient should shower and be decontaminated immediately.\nWaterborne botulism could theoretically result from the ingestion of the pre-formed toxin. However, as common water treatment processes (such as boiling, disinfection with 0.1% hypochlorite bleach solution) destroy the toxin, the risk is considered low.\nBotulism of undetermined origin usually involves adult cases where no food or wound source can be identified. These cases are comparable to infant botulism and may occur when the normal gut flora has been altered as a result of surgical procedures or antibiotic therapy.\nAdverse effects of the pure toxin have been reported as a result of its medical and/or cosmetic use in patients, see more on 'Botox' below."

Early administration is effective in reducing mortality rates. Severe botulism cases require supportive treatment, especially mechanical ventilation, which may be required for weeks or even months. Antibiotics are not required (except in the case of wound botulism).

The vegetative forms of bacteria can be destroyed by boiling but the spores can remain viable after boiling even for several hours. However, the spores can be killed by very high temperature treatments such as commercial canning.\nCommercial heat pasteurization (including vacuum packed pasteurized products and hot smoked products) may not be sufficient to kill all spores and therefore the safety of these products must be based on preventing bacterial growth and toxin production. Refrigeration temperatures combined with salt content and/or acidic conditions will prevent the growth of the bacteria and formation of toxin.\nThe WHOFive Keys to Safer Foodserve as the basis for educational programmes to train food handlers and educate the consumers.

Studies that were interpreted as indicating any such link were flawed, and some of the authors had undeclared biases that influenced what they reported about their research(2,3,4).\nEvidence also shows that other childhood vaccines do not increase the risk of autism. Extensive research into the preservative thiomersal and the additive aluminium that are contained in some inactivated vaccines strongly concluded that these constituents in childhood vaccines do not increase the risk of autism.\nAssessment and care\nA broad range of interventions, from early childhood and across the life span, can optimize the development, health, well-being and quality of life of autistic people. Timely access to early evidence-based psychosocial interventions can improve the ability\r\n    of autistic children to communicate effectively and interact socially. The monitoring of child development as part of routine maternal and child health care is recommended.\nIt is important that, once autism has been diagnosed, children, adolescents and adults with autism and their carers are offered relevant information, services, referrals, and practical support, in accordance with their individual and evolving needs and\r\n    preferences.\nThe health-care needs of people with autism are complex and require a range of integrated services, that include health promotion, care and rehabilitation. Collaboration between the health sector and other sectors, particularly education, employment and\r\n    social care, is important.\nInterventions for people with autism and other developmental disabilities need to be designed and delivered with the participation of people living with these conditions.

However, they may, in addition, have specific health-care needs related to autism or other co-occurring conditions. They may be more vulnerable to developing chronic noncommunicable\r\n    conditions because of behavioural risk factors such as physical inactivity and poor dietary preferences, and are at greater risk of violence, injury and abuse.\nPeople with autism require accessible health services for general health-care needs like the rest of the population, including promotive and preventive services and treatment of acute and chronic illness. Nevertheless, autistic people have higher rates\r\n    of unmet health-care needs compared with the general population. They are also more vulnerable during humanitarian emergencies.

This is often due to physical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases.\nPeople with schizophrenia often experience human rights violations both inside mental health institutions and in community settings. Stigma against people with this condition is intense and widespread, causing social exclusion, and impacting their relationships\r\n    with others, including family and friends.

People at risk are:\npreschool children;school-age children;women of reproductive age (including pregnant women in the second and third trimesters and breastfeeding women); andadults in certain high-risk occupations such as tea-pickers or miners.\nWHO recommends periodic medicinal treatment (deworming or preventive chemotherapy) without previous individual diagnosis to all at-risk people living in endemic areas. This intervention reduces morbidity by reducing the worm burden. In addition:\nhealth and hygiene education reduces transmission and reinfection by encouraging healthy behaviours; andprovision of adequate sanitation is also important but not always possible in resource-poor settings.\nPeriodical treatment aims to reduce and maintain the intensity of infection low, and to protect infected at-risk populations from morbidity.\nDeworming can be easily integrated with child health days or vitamin A supplementation programmes for preschool children, Human Papilloma Vaccine (HPV) programme for adolescent girls or integrated with school health programmes.\nWHO added the control of morbidity due toS. stercoralisas an objective for 2030. This is possible because of\u00a0the current availability of pre-qualified ivermectin at affordable cost. Distribution of ivermectin can be organized through the platforms used to control the other soil-transmitted helminthiases. Pilot interventions are presently in place to refine the strategy and evaluate its impact.\nIn 2021, over 500 million children were treated with anthelminthic medicines in endemic countries, corresponding to 62% of all children at risk. In addition, more than 99 million of women of reproductive age were treated with albendazole through the lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of Disease Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost every year because of STH reduced by more than 50%, which correspond to the period of scaling up of preventive chemotherapy (PC) for STH in endemic countries.\nWHO recommend to endemic countries to measure the success of their programmes through epidemiological assessments after 5 to 6 years of PC implementation with effective treatment coverage of >=75% and to adjust their treatment frequency. The indicators to monitor the impact are the prevalence of any STH and the prevalence of moderate and heavy intensity."

Violence against children can:\nResult in death.Homicide, which often involves weapons such as knives and firearms, is among the top four causes of death in adolescents, with boys comprising over 80% of victims and perpetrators.Lead to severe injuries.For every homicide, there are hundreds of predominantly male victims of youth violence who sustain injuries because of physical fighting and assault.Impair brain and nervous system development.Exposure to violence at an early age can impair brain development and damage other parts of the nervous system, as well as the endocrine, circulatory, musculoskeletal, reproductive, respiratory and immune systems, with lifelong consequences. As such, violence against children can negatively affect cognitive development and results in educational and vocational under-achievement.Result in negative coping and health risk behaviours.Children exposed to violence and other adversities are substantially more likely to smoke, misuse alcohol and drugs, and engage in high-risk sexual behaviour. They also have higher rates of anxiety, depression, other mental health problems and suicide.Lead to unintended pregnancies, induced abortions, gynaecological problems, and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.Contribute to a wide range of non-communicable diseasesas children grow older. The increased risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and other health conditions is largely due to the negative coping and health risk behaviours associated with violence.Impact opportunities and future generations.Children exposed to violence and other adversities are more likely to drop out of school, have difficulty finding and keeping a job, and are at heightened risk for later victimization and/or perpetration of interpersonal and self-directed violence, by which violence against children can affect the next generation."

This will significantly reduce the amount of waste that needs to be handled and treated. Waste minimization actions include green procurement and selecting products where shipping is minimized and with less and ecological packaging, switching to re-usables when safe and viable, only ordering/receiving pharmaceuticals based on documented need, and recycling common items including plastic, paper and cardboard.The treatment of health care wastes with chemical disinfectants can result in the release of chemical substances into the environment if those substances are not handled, stored and disposed in an environmentally sound manner.Incineration of waste is widely practised, but inadequate incineration or the incineration of unsuitable materials results in the release of pollutants into the air and in the generation of ash residue. Incinerated materials containing or treated with chlorine can generate dioxins and furans, which are human carcinogens and have been associated with a range of adverse health effects.

Their treatment will depend on the frequency of symptoms and the types of inhalers available.\nUsing an inhaler can be difficult, especially for children and during emergency situations. Using a spacer device makes it easier to use an aerosol inhaler. This helps the medicine to reach the lungs more easily. A spacer is a plastic container with a mouthpiece or mask at one end and a hole for the inhaler in the other. A homemade spacer, made from a 500ml plastic bottle, can be as effective as commercially manufactured spacers.\nAccess to inhalers is a problem in many countries. In 2021, bronchodilators were available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries, and steroid inhalers available in one third.\nIt is also important to raise community awareness to reduce the myths and stigma associated with asthma in some settings."

As we breathe, these particles are deposited on the cells lining the airways, where they can damage DNA and potentially cause lung cancer.\nOutdoors, radon quickly dilutes to very low concentrations and is generally not a problem. The average outdoor radon level(1)varies from 5 Bq/m3to 15 Bq/m3. However, radon concentrations are higher indoors and in areas with minimal ventilation, with highest levels found in places like mines, caves and water treatment facilities. In buildings such as homes, schools, offices, radon levels can vary substantially from 10 Bq/m3to more than 10 000 Bq/m3.

The concentration of radon in buildings depends on:\nthe local geology, for example the uranium content and permeability of the underlying rocks and soils;the routes available for the passage of radon from the soil into the building;the radon exhalation from building materials; andthe rate of exchange between indoor and outdoor air, which depends on the construction of the building, the ventilation habits of the occupants, and the air-tightness of the building.\nRadon enters buildings through cracks in the floors or at floor-wall junctions, gaps around pipes or cables, small pores in hollow-block walls, cavity walls, or sumps or drains. Radon levels are usually higher in basements, cellars and living spaces in contact with the ground. \u00a0However, considerable radon concentration can also be found above the ground floor.\nRadon concentrations vary considerably between adjacent buildings, as well as within a building from day to day and from hour to hour. Because of these fluctuations, it is preferable to estimate the annual mean concentration of radon in indoor air by measurements for at least 3 months. Residential radon levels can be measured in an inexpensive and simple manner by means of small passive detectors. Measurements need to be based on national protocols to ensure consistency as well as reliability for decision-making. Short-term radon tests, done in compliance with national protocols, can be valuable when making decisions during time-sensitive situations, such as home sales or to test the effectiveness of radon mitigation work."

It can also start on other parts of the body where contact was made, such as the genitals. It starts as a flat sore, which develops into a blister filled with liquid that may be itchy or painful. As the rash heals, the lesions dry up, crust over and fall off.\nSome people may have one or a few skin lesions and others have hundreds or more. These can appear anywhere on the body including:\npalms of hands and soles of feetface, mouth and throatgroin and genital areasanus.\nSome people also have painful swelling of their rectum (proctitis) or pain and difficulty when peeing (dysuria) or when swallowing.\nPeople with mpox can pass the disease on to others until all sores have healed and a new layer of skin has formed. Some people can be infected without developing any symptoms. Although getting mpox from someone who is asymptomatic (not showing symptoms) has been reported, information is still limited on how common it is.\nChildren, pregnant people and people with weak immune systems, including people living with HIV that is not well controlled, are at higher risk for serious illness and death due to complications from mpox.\nSome people with mpox become very sick. For example, the skin can become infected with bacteria, leading to abscesses or serious skin damage. Other complications include pneumonia; corneal infection with loss of vision; pain or difficulty swallowing; vomiting and diarrhoea causing dehydration or malnutrition; and infections of the blood (sepsis), brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis), rectum (proctitis), genital organs (balanitis) or urinary passages (urethritis).

It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmitted infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also have another sexually transmitted infection at the same time, such as syphilis or herpes. Alternatively, a child with suspected mpox may also have chickenpox. For these reasons, testing is key for people to get care as early as possible and prevent severe illness and further spread.\nThe preferred laboratory test for mpox is detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash \u2013 skin, fluid or crusts \u2013 collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done using swabs of the throat or anus. Testing blood is not recommended. Antibody detection methods may not be useful as they do not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses.\nHIV testing should be offered to adults with mpox, and children as appropriate. Diagnostic tests for other conditions should be considered where feasible, for example, varicella zoster virus (VZV), syphilis and herpes."

In these cases, the vaccine should be given less than 4 days after contact with someone who has mpox. The vaccine can be given for up to 14 days if the person has not developed symptoms.\nSome antivirals have received emergency use authorization in some countries and are being evaluated in clinical trials. To date, there is no proven effective antiviral treatment for mpox. It is a priority to continue evaluation of therapeutics in robust clinical trials and to focus on optimizing supportive care for patients.\nIndividuals with HIV and mpox should continue taking their antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART should be initiated within 7 days of diagnosis of HIV."

Covering lesions and wearing a well-fitting mask when in the presence of others may help prevent spread. Using condoms during sex will help reduce the risk of getting mpox but will not prevent spread from skin-to-skin or mouth-to-skin contact.\u00a0If having sex, use condoms as a precaution for 12 weeks (about 3 months) after you have recovered.\nTaking a break from sexual activity with new partners during periods of increased transmission can reduce the risk of getting mpox. Those who have had contact with someone with mpox should monitor for signs and symptoms for 21 days (3 weeks) and take precautions such as avoiding sexual activity during this period.\nHealth workers should follow infection prevention and control measures to protect themselves while caring for patients with mpox by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (i.e. gloves, gown, eye protection and respirator) and adhering to protocol for safely swabbing lesions for diagnostic testing and handling sharp objects such as needles."

Since then, mpox has been reported sporadically in central and east Africa (clade I) and west Africa (clade II). In 2003, an outbreak in the United States of America was linked to imported wild animals (clade II). Since 2005, thousands of cases are reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo every year. In 2017, mpox re-emerged in Nigeria and continues to spread between people across the country and in travellers to other destinations.\nData on suspected and confirmed cases reported up to 2021 are availablehereand data on laboratory confirmed cases from 2022 until today are availablehere.\nIn May 2022, an outbreak of mpox appeared suddenly and rapidly spread across Europe, the Americas and then all six WHO regions. The global outbreak has affected primarily (but not only) gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and has spread person-to-person through sexual networks. More information on the global outbreak is availablehere, including information oncommunity responsesto control the outbreak.\nIn 2022, outbreaks of mpox due to clade I occurred in refugee camps in the Republic of the Sudan.\nSince 2022, there has also been an upsurge in mpox cases and deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In some areas of the country, a new offshoot of clade I, called clade Ib, has been spreading person-to-person.

The definitive hosts are infected through the consumption of viscera of intermediate hosts that contain the parasite larvae.\nHumans act as so-called accidental intermediate hosts in the sense that they acquire infection in the same way as other intermediate hosts, but are not involved in transmitting the infection to the definitive host.\nSeveral distinct genotypes ofE. granulosusare recognised, some having distinct intermediate host preferences. Some genotypes are considered species distinct fromE. granulosus. Not all genotypes cause infections in humans. The genotype\r\n    causing the great majority of cystic echinococcosis infections in humans is principally maintained in a dog\u2013sheep\u2013dog cycle, yet several other domestic animals may also be involved, including goats, swine, cattle, camels and yaks.\nAlveolar echinococcosis usually occurs in a wildlife cycle between foxes or other carnivores\u00a0 with small mammals (mostly rodents) acting as intermediate hosts.

If the lung is affected, clinical signs include chronic cough, chest pain and shortness of breath. Other signs depend on the location of the hydatid cysts and the\r\n    pressure exerted on the surrounding tissues. Non-specific signs include anorexia, weight loss and weakness.\nAlveolar echinococcosis is characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period of 5\u201315 years and the slow development of a primary tumour-like lesion which is usually located in the liver. Clinical signs include weight loss, abdominal pain, general\r\n    malaise and signs of hepatic failure.\nLarval metastases may spread either to organs adjacent to the liver (for example, the spleen) or distant locations (such as the lungs, or the brain) following dissemination of the parasite via the blood and lymphatic system.

Surveillance is also not recognized or prioritized by communities or local veterinary services.\nCystic echinococcosis is a preventable disease as it involves domestic animal species as definitive and intermediate hosts. Periodic deworming of dogs with praziquantel (at least 4 times per year), improved hygiene in the slaughtering of livestock (including\r\n    the proper destruction of infected offal), and public education campaigns have been found to lower and, in high-income countries, prevent transmission and alleviate the burden of human disease.\nVaccination of sheep with anE. granulosusrecombinant antigen (EG95) offers encouraging prospects for prevention and control. The vaccine is currently being produced commercially and is registered in China and Argentina. Trials in Argentina\r\n    demonstrated the added value of vaccinating sheep, and in China the vaccine is being used extensively.\nA programme combining vaccination of lambs, deworming of dogs and culling of older sheep could lead to elimination of cystic echinococcosis disease in humans in less than 10 years.\nPrevention and control of alveolar echinococcosis is more complex as the cycle involves wild animal species as both definitive and intermediate hosts. Regular deworming of domestic carnivores that have access to wild rodents should help to reduce the\r\n    risk of infection in humans.\nDeworming of wild and stray definitive hosts with anthelminthic baits resulted in significant reductions in alveolar echinococcosis prevalence in European and Japanese studies.

Eckert (University of Zurich, Switzerland), the groups organised meetings of specialists and promoted international\r\n    scientific exchange and co-operation in the field of echinococcosis research. In 1995, the WHO modified the structure of the groups and transformed them into a single group, the WHO Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis (WHO-IWGE). The mission\r\n    of the WHO-IWGE is to strengthen prevention and control of echinococcosis through effective collaboration with strategic partners and relevant sectors. The current Chair of the WHO-IWGE is Professor Thomas Junghanss (Heidelberg University, Germany),\r\n    and Co-Chair is Professor Okan Akhan (Hacettepe University, Turkey).\nThe WHO-IWGE developed in 1995 a standardized classification of cystic echinococcosis (CE) that could be applied in all settings.\u00a0 In 2009, the consensus for diagnosis and treatment of CE and alveolar echinococcosis (AE) reached by the WHO-IWGE was\r\n    published (Brunetti et al., 2010), providing updated guidelines for diagnosis and treatment.\nThe WHO-IWGE is in the process of reviewing the diagnosis and associated clinical management of echinococcosis and elaborating technical manuals with practical applicability.\u00a0 Several workings groups have been created to cover the different aspects\r\n    of the diseases and are working on creating those documents. The group is also working to promote the collection and mapping of epidemiological data.\nWHO has been asked by the endemic countries to provide support on early diagnosis and clinical management of cystic echinococcosis.\u00a0 WHO supports capacity building through training courses targeting medical and paramedical personnel, focused on the\r\n    clinical management of cystic echinococcosis in rural areas of affected countries. This is an integral component to support universal health coverage.\nMorocco undertook a project aimed at decentralizing diagnostic and therapeutic techniques and promoting the PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, re-aspiration) strategy in rural and hyperendemic areas.\nMongolia has recognized the importance of echinococcosis as a public-health problem and, at the request of the Ministry of Health, WHO in 2013 conducted an initial situation analysis. The analysis focused on implementing early diagnosis and building a\r\n    basic surveillance system covering humans and animals to understand the actual burden of the disease.\nA cross-sectional study conducted in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey in 2014-2015, found that the true burden of CE is poorly understood and that many cases remain asymptomatic, with no appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment. The study assessed the\r\n    prevalence of the disease among rural populations in the three countries.\nIn the Americas, a cystic echinococcosis control manual was produced by the Pan American Health Organization / WHO Regional Office for the Americas (OPS) and Panaftosa in 2017. It has been published in Spanish.\nThe transmission cycle of cystic echinococcosis (CE) involves dogs, and intermediate hosts, commonly sheep. In order to break the transmission cycle, control measures need to consider those animals. Control measures in dogs and sheep, as part of a One-Health\r\n    approach include the deworming of dogs with praziquantel at least 4 times per year and the vaccination of lambs with EG95 vaccine.\nUnder the umbrella of One Health, WHO and its partner, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) are supporting the development of echinococcosis control programs including animal interventions.\u00a0 Joint meetings are being held regularly and technical\r\n    support is provided to promote control, for example in the Central Asia and South Caucasus countries.\nWHO assists countries to develop and implement pilot projects leading to the validation of effective cystic echinococcosis control strategies. Working with the veterinary and food safety authorities as well as with other sectors is essential to attain\r\n    the long-term outcomes of reducing the burden of disease and safeguarding the food value chain.\nWHO is supporting individual countries to develop their CE control program such as in Mongolia. In 2018, a multidisciplinary stakeholder meeting was convened in Ulaanbaatar to start developing the National Action Plan for control of echinococcosis. No\r\n    significant investment for echinococcosis has been made, and therefore programmatic steps have been progressing slowly but WHO continues to bring the stakeholders together and further actions have been agreed in 2019. WHO has also facilitated the\r\n    validation of diagnostic tests used for echinococcosis in dogs that is important for surveillance, and create a baseline in Bayankhongor province of Mongolia.\nChina is integrating echinococcosis prevention, control and treatment in their economic and development plans to raise attention to the vast problem in the country, especially the Tibetan plateau, as well as in the Central Asian Republics.\nWHO is promoting One-Health approaches, such as the one developed by Dr Larrieu in the Argentinian Patagonia which involves community health workers, dog deworming and sheep vaccination.\nSurveillance data is key to understand the disease epidemiological situation and taking action in the risk areas, and for setting up priorities. Data is also necessary to monitor the progress of interventions and evaluate the outcomes of control actions.\nIndicators are specific variables that assist with the data analysis and provide tools for health authorities and people involved in disease control. \u00a0WHO has defined a new set of indicators at country and global level for CE and is developing reporting systems to guide and assist the countries on data collection and reporting.\nAt global level, the indicators are 1- Number of endemic countries for CE, and 2- Number of countries with intensified control in hyper endemic areas. A hyperendemic area has been defined as an area with an annual incidence of 5 human cases/100,000 people.\nAt country level there are epidemiological indicators and control progress indicators.\u00a0 The epidemiological indicators include a combination of passive and active surveillance.\u00a0 The control indicators include impact and outcome indicators.\n(1)One DALY (disability-adjusted life year) can be thought of as one lost year of \u201chealthy\u201d life. The sum of these DALYs across the population, or the burden of disease, can be thought of as a measurement of the gap between current\r\n        health status and an ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age free of disease and disability."

The most susceptible hosts are immuno-compromised patients, including organ transplant recipients and cancer patients and those receiving corticosteroid treatment.\nDelay in diagnosis and administration of appropriate antibiotic treatment, increasing age and presence of co-existing diseases are predictors of death from Legionnaires\u2019 disease.\nSymptoms"

        "content": "Legionellosis is a generic term describing the pneumonic and non-pneumonic forms of infection withLegionella.\nThe non-pneumonic form (Pontiac disease) is an acute, self-limiting influenza-like illness usually lasting 2\u20135 days. The incubation period is from a few and up to 48 hours. The main symptoms are fever, chills, headache, malaise and muscle pain (myalgia). No deaths are associated with this type of infection.\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease, the pneumonic form, has an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (but up to 16 days has been recorded in some outbreaks). Initially, symptoms are fever, loss of appetite, headache, malaise and lethargy. Some patients may also have muscle pain, diarrhoea and confusion. There is also usually an initial mild cough, but as many as 50% of patients can present phlegm. Blood-streaked phlegm or hemoptysis occurs in about one-third of the patients. The severity of disease ranges from a mild cough to a rapidly fatal pneumonia. Death occurs through progressive pneumonia with respiratory failure and/or shock and multi-organ failure.\nUntreated Legionnaires\u2019 disease usually worsens during the first week. In common with other risk factors causing severe pneumonia, the most frequent complications of legionellosis are respiratory failure, shock and acute kidney and multi-organ failure. Recovery always requires antibiotic treatment, and is usually complete, after several weeks or months. In rare occasions, severe progressive pneumonia or ineffective treatment for pneumonia can result in brain sequelae.\nThe death rate as a result of Legionnaires\u2019 disease depends on the severity of the disease, the appropriateness of initial anti-microbial treatment, the setting whereLegionellawas acquired, and host factors (for example, the disease is usually more serious in patients with immuno-suppression). The death rate may be as high as 40\u201380% in untreated immuno-suppressed patients and can be reduced to 5\u201330% through appropriate case management and depending on the severity of the clinical signs and symptoms. Overall the death rate is usually within the range of 5\u201310%.\nResponse"

        "content": "Treatments exist, but there is no vaccine currently available for Legionnaires\u2019 disease.\nThe nonpneumonic form of infection is self-limiting and does not require medical interventions, including antibiotic treatment. Patients with Legionnaires\u2019 disease always require antibiotic treatment following diagnosis.\nThe public health threat posed by legionellosis can be addressed by implementing water safety plans by authorities responsible for building safety or water system safety. These plans must be specific to the building or water system and should result in the introduction and regular monitoring of control measures against identified risks includingLegionella. Although it is not always possible to eradicate the source of infection, it is possible to reduce the risks substantially.\nPrevention of Legionnaires\u2019 disease depends on applying control measures to minimize the growth ofLegionellaand dissemination of aerosols. These measures include good maintenance of devices, including regular cleaning and disinfection and applying other physical (temperature) or chemical measures (biocide) to minimize growth. Some examples are:\nthe regular maintenance, cleaning and disinfection of cooling towers together with frequent or continuous addition of biocides;installation of drift eliminators to reduce dissemination of aerosols from cooling towers;maintaining an adequate level of a biocide such as chlorine in a spa pool along with a complete drain and clean of the whole system at least weekly;keeping hot and cold water systems clean and either keeping the hot water above 50 \u00b0C (which requires water leaving the heating unit to be at or above 60 \u00b0C) and the cold below 25 \u00b0C and ideally below 20 \u00b0C or alternatively treating them with a suitable biocide to limit growth, particularly in hospitals and other health care settings, and aged-care facilities; andreducing stagnation by flushing unused taps in buildings on a weekly basis.\nApplying such controls will greatly reduce the risk ofLegionellacontamination and prevent the occurrence of sporadic cases and outbreaks. Extra precautions may be required for water and ice provided to highly susceptible patients in hospitals including those at risk of aspiration (for example, ice machines can be a source ofLegionellaand should not be used by highly susceptible patients).\nControl and prevention measures must be accompanied by proper vigilance on the part of general practitioners and community health services for the detection of cases.\nWHO makes available technical resources to support the management and control of legionellosis and advises Member States when specific queries are raised."

It can lead to septic shock, multiple organ failure and death.\nSepsis is usually caused by bacterial infections but may be the result of other infections such as viruses, parasites or fungi. Its treatment requires medical care, including the use of antimicrobials, intravenous fluids and other measures.\nSepsis acquired in health care settings is one of the most frequent adverse events during care delivery and affect hundreds of millions of patients worldwide every year.\nHealthcare associated infections are caused by pathogens that are often resistant to drugs and can rapidly lead to deteriorating clinical conditions. Antimicrobial resistance is a major factor determining clinical unresponsiveness to treatment and rapid evolution to sepsis and septic shock. Sepsis patients with resistant pathogens have been found to have a higher risk of hospital mortality. There were an estimated 4.95\u00a0million deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance in 2019, including 1.27\u00a0million deaths directly attributable to it(5).\nImplementing preventive measures against infections, such as good hygiene practices, ensuring access to vaccination programmes, improved sanitation and water quality and availability, and other infection prevention and control best practices both in the community and health care settings, are key steps in reducing the occurrence of sepsis. Early diagnosis and timely and appropriate clinical management of sepsis, such as optimal antimicrobial use and fluid resuscitation, are crucial to increase the likelihood of survival. Even though the onset of sepsis can be acute and poses a short-term mortality burden, it can also be the cause of significant long-term morbidity requiring treatment and support.

Children are often involved in waste picking and scavenging, burning discarded e-waste and the manual dismantlement of items into component parts. In some countries, children may serve as a source of cheap labour and their small hands give them an advantage in taking apart the smallest items. These activities directly expose children to injury and high levels of hazardous substances. Working as a waste picker is hazardous labour and is considered one of the worst forms of child labour by the ILO. In 2020, the ILO estimated that as many as 16.5\u00a0million children globally were working in the industrial sector, of which waste processing is a subsector(4). It is unknown how many child labourers participate in informal e-waste recycling.\nE-waste exposure may be linked to the following health effects during pregnancy and in infants and children:\nadverse neonatal outcomes, including increased rates of stillbirth and premature birth;neurodevelopment, learning and behaviour outcomes, especially associated with lead released through informal e-waste recycling activities;reduced lung and respiratory function and increased asthma incidence, which may be linked to high levels of contaminated air pollution that characterize many e-waste recycling sites.\nChildren and pregnant women are at high risk to hazardous substances released through informal e-waste recycling activities due to their unique vulnerabilities. Children have different exposuresto e-waste recycling activities than adults. E-waste recycling activities release toxic chemicals that can cross the placenta and may contaminate breastmilk, for example mercury. Fetuses and young children are highly sensitive to many pollutants released through e-waste recycling due to their rapidly developing bodies, including their respiratory, immune and central nervous systems. E-waste contains several known neurotoxicants, including lead and mercury, that may disrupt the development of the central nervous system during pregnancy, infancy, childhood and adolescence. Some harmful toxicants from e-waste may also impact the structural development and function of the lungs.

The disease results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock.\nRVF virus is a member of thePhlebovirusgenus. The virus was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an epidemic among sheep in the Rift Valley of Kenya.\nSince then, outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1977 an explosive outbreak was reported in Egypt, where the RVF virus was introduced via infected livestock trade along the Nile irrigation system. In 1997\u201398, a major outbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania following El Ni\u00f1o event and extensive flooding. Following infected livestock trade from the horn of Africa, RVF spread in September 2000 to Saudi Arabia and Yemen, marking the first reported occurrence of the disease outside the African continent and raising concerns that it could extend to other parts of Asia and Europe."

The dominant vector species varies between different regions, and different species can play different roles in sustaining the transmission of the virus.\nAmong animals, the RVF virus is spread primarily by the bite of infected mosquitoes, mainly theAedesspecies, which can acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals. The female mosquito is also capable of transmitting the virus directly to her offspring via eggs leading to new generations of infected mosquitoes hatching from eggs.\nRVF virus is able to infect many species of animals causing severe disease in domesticated animals including cattle, sheep, camels and goats. Sheep and goats appear to be more susceptible than cattle or camels. An outbreak of RVF in animals frequently manifests itself as a wave of unexplained abortions among livestock and may signal the start of an epidemic.\nThe analysis of major RVF outbreaks show two ecologically distinct situations :\nPrimary foci areas.RVF virus persists through transmission between vectors and hosts and maintains through vertical transmission inAedesmosquitoes.Spread to secondary foci.During major outbreak at primary foci, the disease can spread through livestock movement or passive mosquitoes dispersal. The transmission can then amplify in na\u00efve ruminants via local competent mosquitoes likeCulex,MansoniaandAnophelesthat act as mechanical vectors. Irrigation schemes, where populations of mosquitoes are abundant during long periods of the year, are highly favourable places for secondary disease transmission."

There is some evidence that humans may become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes, most commonly theAedesandCulexmosquitoes.

Some patients develop neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, loss of appetite and vomiting. In these patients the disease, in its early stages, may be mistaken for meningitis.\nThe symptoms of RVF usually last from 4 to 7 days, after which time the immune response becomes detectable with the appearance of antibodies and the virus disappears from the blood.\nA small percentage of patients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually appears as one or more of the three following syndromes:\nOcular(eye)form(0.5\u20132% of patients):symptoms associated with the mild form of the disease are accompanied by retinal lesions. The lesions in the eyes usually appear 1 to 3 weeks after the first symptoms. Patients report blurred or decreased vision. The disease may resolve itself within 10 to 12 weeks. However, when the lesions occur in the macula, 50% of patients will experience a permanent loss of vision.Meningoencephalitis form(less than 1% of patients):The onset of the meningoencephalitis form usually occurs 1 to 4 weeks after the first symptoms of RVF appear. Clinical features include intense headache, loss of memory, hallucinations, confusion, disorientation, vertigo, convulsions, lethargy and coma. Neurological complications can appear two months or more later. While death rate in these patients is low, residual neurological deficit, which may be severe, is common.Haemorrhagic fever form(less than 1% of patients):The symptoms of this form appear 2\u20134 days after the onset of illness, and begin with evidence of severe liver impairment. Subsequently signs of haemorrhage then appear such as vomiting blood, passing blood in the faeces, a purpuric rash or ecchymose, bleeding from the nose or gums, menorrhagia and bleeding from venepuncture sites.

Both modified live attenuated virus and inactivated virus vaccines have been developed for veterinary use.\nAnimal immunization must be implemented prior to an outbreak if an epizootic is to be prevented. Once an outbreak has occurred, animal vaccination should NOT be implemented because there is a high risk of intensifying the outbreak through the use of multi-dose vials and the re-use of needles and syringes.\nRestricting or banning the movement of livestock may be effective in slowing the expansion of the virus from infected to uninfected areas.\nAs outbreaks of RVF in animals precede human cases, the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system to detect new cases is essential in providing early warning for veterinary and human public health authorities.\nRaising awareness of the risk factors of RVF infection as well as the protective measures individuals can take to prevent mosquito bites is the only way to reduce human infection.\nPublic health messages for risk reduction should focus on:\nreducing the risk of animal-to-human transmissionas a result of unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Practicing hand hygiene, wearing gloves and other appropriate individual protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals;reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmissionarising from the unsafe consumption of fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue. In the epizootic regions, all animal products (blood, meat, and milk) should be thoroughly cooked before eating;the importance of personal and community protection against mosquito bitesthrough the use of impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, light-coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers) and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species;vector controlusinglarviciding measures at mosquito breeding sites if they can be clearly identified and are limited in size and extent. During periods of flooding the number and extent of breeding sites is usually too high for larviciding measures to be feasible.\nAlthough no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been demonstrated, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of the virus from infected patients to healthcare workers through contact with infected blood or tissues. Healthcare and laboratory workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed RVF should implement standard precautions when handling specimens from patients.\nForecasting can predict climatic conditions that are frequently associated with an increased risk of outbreaks, and may improve disease control. In Africa, Saudi Arabia and Yemen RVF outbreaks are closely associated with periods of above-average rainfall; in East Africa they are closely associated with the heavy rainfall that occurs during the warm phase of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation phenomenon.\nForecasting models and early warning systems for RVF using satellite images and weather/climate forecasting data can be used to trigger detection of animal cases at an early stage of an outbreak, enabling authorities to implement measures to avert epidemics."

Symptoms can come and go or last for a long time.\nThe causes of MS are not known but a family history of the disease may increase the risk.\nWhile there is no cure for MS, treatment can reduce symptoms, prevent further relapses and improve quality of life.\nMS can present in a variety of ways including:\nclinically isolated syndrome (CIS): describes an episode of neurologic symptoms that are the first clinical sign of possible MS;relapsing remitting (RRMS): the most common form of MS characterized by intermittent attacks of symptoms (relapses), followed by a short or long period of no clinical attacks (remissions);secondary progressive (SPMS): after living with RRMS for a long period of time, relapses decrease and symptoms continue progressively without relapses or remissions; andprimary progressive (PPMS): starting from the initial symptoms, the disease gradually progresses and gets worse without any clear relapses or remissions.\nMS is not always easy to diagnose in its early stages. Typically, people who have been diagnosed with MS will have been through several diagnostic stages, which can be an unsettling and frightening experience."

Other medicines can be used to reduce the symptoms of MS such as fatigue, muscle tightening, depression and urinary or sexual problems. These medicines do not change the course of the disease but help manage the symptoms.\nRehabilitation specialists can help improve functioning, quality of life and reduce muscle stiffness and spasms.\nMany people feel fatigue with multiple sclerosis. Ways to manage fatigue include:\nregular exercisehealthy sleep patternsavoiding medicines that make fatigue worse.\nIn the past twenty years treatment options for MS have improved dramatically. In high income countries many oral, intravenous and injectable options exist to treat MS. However, most of these medications are not available in low- and middle-income countries and there is still a lack of treatment options for progressive types of MS.\nPeople with MS and their families should be encouraged to seek services and guidance from local and national Organizations of Disabled People (ODPs) and other disability focused organizations, which can provide vital advice about legal rights, economic opportunities and social engagement to ensure that people disabled by MS or other neurological disorders are able to live full and rewarding lives."

Efforts to prevent transmission should first focus on personal and community protection against mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets, personal insect repellent, by wearing light coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers) and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times. In addition community programmes should encourage communities to destroy mosquito breeding sites in residential areas.Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission. Gloves and other protective clothing should be worn while handling sick animals or their tissues, and during slaughtering and culling procedures.Reducing the risk of transmission through blood transfusion and organ transplant. Blood and organ donation restrictions and laboratory testing should be considered at the time of the outbreak in the affected areas after assessing the local/regional epidemiological situation.\nEffective prevention of human WNV infections depends on the development of comprehensive, integrated mosquito surveillance and control programmes in areas where the virus occurs.

Health-care workers may also not have the necessary knowledge to appropriately diagnose and manage strep throat. If left untreated, rheumatic fever may then ensue.\nCurrentlya large proportion of those suffering rheumatic heart disease are not diagnosed or are diagnosed at a late stage when damage to the heart is very severe. Rheumatic heart disease\u00a0remains the leading cause of maternal cardiac complications in\u00a0pregnancy. In many rheumatic heart disease-endemic countries there is little or no access to life-saving heart valve surgery. Measures to halt the progression to severe rheumatic heart disease require long-term treatments and a well-functioning health system to deliver this service. Additionally, because treatment is long-term, it can be costly and challenging for patients to regularly visit a health-care facility, and some patients may avoid the injections due to discomfort or fear of adverse events.\nA steady supply of benzathine penicillin G is an essential prerequisite for treatment of sore throat and to prevent recurrent infection. However, the antibiotic is prone to global shortages. High manufacturing costs and low purchase prices have pushed some manufacturers out of the market while demand for the drug is rising.

        "content": "Experiencing distress or other mental health difficulties after a potentially traumatic event is common but does not mean someone is experiencing PTSD.Someone experiences PTSD when they have symptomsre-experiencing the event, avoid reminders of the event and experience symptoms of heightened arousal that cause significant distress, and interfere with daily activities and family, social, school or working life.\nPeople with PTSD have repeated and unwanted recollections of the traumatic event(s), which make them feel as if the event(s) is happening all over again. These memories are accompanied by intense fear or horror. They may be experienced as images, sounds (e.g. gunfire), smells (e.g. the odour of an assailant) or other sensations. These recollections might occur through intrusive memories, nightmares, or, in severe cases, flashbacks. During flashbacks, the person might momentarily believe and act as if they were back at the time of the event, experiencing it again.\nPeople with PTSD avoid situations, activities, thoughts or memories that remind them of the traumatic event(s). They may even avoid talking about the event(s) with their family or health care providers. People usually use these strategies to try to avoid distressing recollections. Yet avoidance strategies may inadvertently intensify re-experiencing symptoms over time and thus perpetuate the presence of PTSD.\nPeople with PTSD may experience a heightened sense of danger, even when they are not actually at risk. This can involve them being much more vigilant than usual, for example constantly scanning their surroundings for potential threats or feeling the need to sit with their back against a wall in public places. They may be more easily startled or jumpy, reacting with excessive fear to sudden movements or loud noises.\nSymptoms of PTSD typically begin immediately after or within one month of a traumatic event. In younger children, symptoms are often behavioural and can include re-enacting the traumatic event during play or in drawings. Children often unjustly blame themselves for what happened. The experience of PTSD can also vary across cultures. For instance, in some cultures, it may be more acceptable to express anger about the event, making this a more prominent experience. In other cultures, people with PTSD may more commonly have physical complaints with unclear causes, such as headaches or gastrointestinal symptoms.\nPeople with PTSD may also havedepressive disorder,anxiety disorders andsubstance use disordersas well assuicidal thoughts and behaviours. Many of the effects of PTSD (such as physical tension or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for physical diseases such as cardiovascular disease."

Anyone can experience PTSD after a potentially traumatic event, but people who have previously experienced traumatic events are more susceptible. Women are more likely to experience PTSD than men. Other factors, including a family history of mental health conditions, younger age, and lower levels of education, can also increase the likelihood of developing PTSD after a potentially traumatic experience.\nThe nature of the event experienced can also affect the chances of developing PTSD. For example, experiencing ongoing or repeated potentially traumatic events, developing a serious physical injury during the event(s), or witnessing harm to others can all increase risk. Receiving social support following \u00a0potentially traumatic events can reduce the risk for PTSD."

They can help people manage difficult situations and address the events, people or places that trigger their traumatic memories.\nThe psychological interventions with the most evidence for effective treatment of PTSD are those based on cognitive behavioural therapy with a trauma focus and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). Many of these involve exposure techniques, in which the person is asked to recall, narrate or imagine the traumatic event(s) so that they are exposed to their memories within a safe and supportive environment.

This is in contrast to relying on income or another means of assessment to determine whether an individual is entitled to exemption from user fees.\nWith limited budget resources to fund FHC as a way to make progress towards UHC, there are inevitable trade-offs, which lead to decisions about prioritizing particular services or population groups over others."

Transparency and accountability are important aspects, as eligible people need to know if the policy applies to them.\nWhile FHC policies may trigger an increase in the use of services, evidence on improved financial protection is mixed. People may still have to make direct payments for other services they need.\nMoreover, if not properly anticipated and backed by increased supplies and medicines, FHC may have negative unintended consequences, such as patients having to pay for this scarce supply informally or in the private sector. Also, if user fees previously retained at the facility level are abolished, their effect as a direct incentive for health workers disappears, possibly leading to demotivated staff.\nOverall, the impacts of FHC policies have so far been mixed, especially for poor people, who may not benefit at all, or benefit to a lesser extent compared with better-off people. There are differences across and within countries, but overall, public funding tends to benefit better-off populations. Various aspects on the supply and demand sides may cause this trend in public funding. On the supply side, availability of health services is better in wealthier areas. On the demand-side, barriers can be financial and non-financial, such as limited geographical access to facilities or cultural and language barriers.\nFinally, setting up separate funding and remuneration mechanisms for FHC policies (when not linked with other health financing mechanisms) may contribute to fragmenting the health financing system. When there are several FHC policies in place for a variety of services, they may create disincentives to enrol in health insurance schemes with more comprehensive benefit packages."

Prevalence among children in these settings may vary from 5% up to 50%. Recurrent infestations are common. The sheer burden of scabies infestation and its complications imposes a major cost on health care systems. Cases are sporadic in high-income countries, yet outbreaks in health institutions and vulnerable communities contribute to significant economic cost in national health services.\nSeveral studies have shown that outbreaks of scabies are a major risk factor for kidney disease in the form of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

Sometimes there are visible signs before symptoms begin.\nSymptoms of scabies include:\nsevere itch, often worse at night;itchy lines (linear burrows) and bumps (papules) on the fingers, wrists, arms, legs and belt area;enflamed bumps on male genitalia and female breasts; andlarger rash in infants and small children, including on the palms, soles of the feet, ankles and scalp.\nMost individuals are infected with 10\u201315 mites.\nPeople with suppressed immune systems, including people living with HIV, may develop crusted (Norwegian) scabies. This severe infection can have thousands or millions or mites and causes dry, scaley areas on the skin. It often does not cause itch. Crusted scabies spreads very easily and can cause secondary infections. It is life threatening.\nScabies mites burrow into the top layer of skin, where the adult female lays eggs. The eggs hatch in 3\u20134 days and develop into adult mites in 1\u20132 weeks. After 4\u20136 weeks the patient develops an allergic reaction to the presence of mite proteins and faeces in the scabies burrow, causing intense itch and rash.\nMite effects on immunity, as well as the direct effects of scratching, can lead to inoculation of the skin with bacteria, leading to the development of impetigo (skin sores), especially in the tropics. Impetigo may become complicated by deeper skin infection such as abscesses or serious invasive disease, including septicaemia. In tropical settings, scabies-associated skin infection is a common risk factor for kidney disease and possibly rheumatic heart disease. Evidence of acute renal damage can be found in up to 10% of children with scabies infestation in resource-poor settings and, in many, this persists for years following infection contributing to permanent kidney damage."

In 2019 WHO convened aninformal consultationof global experts to review available data and develop recommendations on strategies for global and country level control. The experts agreed that there is convincing evidence that MDA can be highly effective in places where the prevalence is 10% or greater, but the evidence for its effectiveness in places with lower prevalence is less clear. The current recommendation is that two doses of ivermectin (dose 200\u00b5g/kg) should be administered and a topical agent such as permethrin 5% cream should be given when ivermectin is contraindicated or not available. There is ongoing research to determine if one dose of treatment is sufficient for MDA, however currently the evidence is inconclusive. Further research is required to define the strategies to be used when the prevalence is low, either at baseline or when achieved by MDA.\nOutbreaks of scabies can occur in either closed, institutional settings (such as hospitals, boarding schools or long-term care facilities) or open community settings. Refugee or internally displaced person camps are at particularly high risk due to overcrowding which increases skin to skin contact. Outbreaks can be extended and difficult to control. The general principles include surveillance in high-risk settings, early confirmation of an outbreak, and involvement of public health experts.\nThe WHO informal consultation on a Framework for Scabies Control Meeting Report outlines the key operational research that is still required to develop guidelines for control and surveillance strategy for all contexts.\nLarge scale scabies MDAs are ongoing in PNG, Vanuatu, Fiji and Solomon Islands."

Chemical contamination can lead to acute poisoning or long-term diseases, such as cancer. Many foodborne diseases may lead to long-lasting disability and death. Some examples of food hazards are listed below.\nSalmonella, Campylobacterand enterohaemorrhagicEscherichia coliare some of the most common foodborne pathogens that affect millions of people annually, sometimes with severe and fatal outcomes. Symptoms can include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Foods more frequently involved in outbreaks of salmonellosis include eggs, poultry and other products of animal origin. Foodborne cases due toCampylobacterare mainly caused by raw milk, raw or undercooked poultry and drinking water. EnterohaemorrhagicEscherichia coliis often associated with unpasteurized milk, undercooked meat and contaminated fresh fruits and vegetables.\nListeriainfections can lead to miscarriage in pregnant women or death of newborn babies. Although disease occurrence is relatively low,Listeria\u2019s severe and sometimes fatal health consequences, particularly among infants, children and the elderly, count them among the most serious foodborne infections.Listeriais found in unpasteurised dairy products and various ready-to-eat foods and can grow at refrigeration temperatures.\nVibrio choleraecan infect people through contaminated water or food. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, vomiting and profuse watery diarrhoea, which quickly lead to severe dehydration and possibly death. Raw vegetablesand various types of raw or undercooked seafood have been implicated in cholera outbreaks.\nAntimicrobials, such as antibiotics, are essential to treat infections caused by bacteria, including foodborne pathogens. However, their overuse and misuse in veterinary and human medicine has been linked to the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria, rendering the treatment of infectious diseases ineffective in animals and humans.\nSome viruses can be transmitted by food consumption. Norovirus is a common cause of foodborne infections that is characterized by nausea, explosive vomiting, watery diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Hepatitis A virus can also be transmitted by food and can cause long-lasting liver disease and typically spreads through raw or undercooked seafood or contaminated raw produce.\nSome parasites, such as fish-borne trematodes, are only transmitted through food. Others, for example tapeworms likeEchinococcusspp, orTaeniaspp, may infect people through food or direct contact with animals. Other parasites, such asAscaris, Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba histolyticaorGiardia, enter the food chain via water or soil and can contaminate fresh produce.\nPrions, infectious agents composed of protein, are unique in that they are associated with specific forms of neurodegenerative disease. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or so-called mad cow disease) is a prion disease in cattle, associated with the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans. Consuming meat products containing specified risk material, such as brain tissue, is the most likely route of transmission of the prion agent to humans.\nOf most concern for health are naturally occurring toxins and environmental pollutants.\nNaturally occurring toxinsinclude mycotoxins, marine biotoxins, cyanogenic glycosides and toxins occurring in poisonous mushrooms. Staple foods like corn or cereals can contain high levels of mycotoxins, such as aflatoxin and ochratoxin, produced by mould on grain. Long-term exposure can affect the immune system and normal development, or cause cancer.Persistent organic pollutants (POPs)are compounds that accumulate in the environment and human body. Known examples are dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are unwanted by-products of industrial processes and waste incineration. They are found worldwide in the environment and accumulate in animal food chains. Dioxins are highly toxic and can cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and cause cancer.Heavy metalssuch as lead, cadmium and mercury cause neurological and kidney damage. Contamination by heavy metal in food occurs mainly through pollution of water and soil.\nOther chemical hazards\u00a0infoodcan include radioactive nucleotides that can be discharged into the environment from industries and from civil or military nuclear operations, food allergens, residues of drugs and other contaminants incorporated in the food during the process."

However, no single test can provide a full HIV positive diagnosis; confirmatory testing is required, conducted by a qualified and trained health worker or community worker. HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO prequalified tests within a nationally approved testing strategy and algorithm.\nMost widely used HIV diagnostic tests detect antibodies produced by a person as part of their immune response to fight HIV. In most cases, people develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection. During this time, people are in the so-called \u201cwindow period\u201d when they have low levels of antibodies which cannot be detected by many rapid tests, but they may still transmit HIV to others. People who have had a recent high-risk exposure and test negative can have a further test after 28 days.\nFollowing a positive diagnosis, people should be retested before they are enrolled in treatment and care to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. While testing for adolescents and adults has been made simple and efficient, this is not the case for babies born to HIV-positive mothers. For children less than 18 months of age, rapid antibody testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection \u2013 virological testing must be provided as early as birth or at 6 weeks of age.

Their half-life in the body is estimated to be 7 to 11 years. In the environment, dioxins tend to accumulate in the food chain. The higher an animal is in the food chain, the higher the concentration of dioxins.\nThe chemical name for dioxin is 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin (TCDD). The name dioxins is often used for the family of structurally and chemically relatedpolychlorinated dibenzo para dioxins (PCDDs)andpolychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs).Certain dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with similar toxic properties are also included under the term dioxins.

Uncontrolled waste incinerators (solid waste and hospital waste) are often the worst culprits of environmental release due to incomplete burning. Technology is available that allows for controlled waste incineration with low dioxin emissions.\nAlthough formation of dioxins is local, environmental distribution is global. The highest levels are found in some soils, sediments and food, especially dairy products, meat, fish and shellfish. Very low levels are found in plants, water and air.\nExtensive stores of PCB-based waste industrial oils, many with high levels of PCDFs, exist throughout the world. Long-term storage and improper disposal of this material may result in dioxin release into the environment and the contamination of human and animal food supplies. PCB-based waste is not easily disposed of without contamination of the environment and human populations. Such material needs to be treated as hazardous waste and is best destroyed by high temperature incineration in specialized facilities."

Long-term exposure is linked to impairment of the immune system, the developing nervous system, the endocrine system and reproductive functions.\nChronic exposure of animals to dioxins has resulted in several types of cancer. TCDD was evaluated by the WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 1997 and 2012. Based on animal and human epidemiology data, TCDD was classified by IARC as a known human carcinogen. However, TCDD does not affect genetic material and there is a level of exposure below which cancer risk would be negligible.\nDue to the omnipresence of dioxins, all people have background exposure and a certain level of dioxins in the body, leading to the so-called body burden. Current normal background exposure is not expected to affect human health on average. However, due to the high toxic potential of this class of compounds, efforts are needed to reduce current background exposure.\nThe developing fetus is most sensitive to dioxin exposure. Newborns, with rapidly developing organ systems, may also be more vulnerable to certain effects. Some people or groups of people may be exposed to higher levels of dioxins because of their diet (such as high consumers of fish in certain parts of the world) or their occupation (such as workers in the pulp and paper industry, in incineration plants, and at hazardous waste sites)."

The incineration process requires temperatures over 850 \u00b0C. For the destruction of large amounts of contaminated material, temperatures of 1000 \u00b0C or more are required.\nPrevention or reduction of human exposure is best done via source-directed measures, i.e. strict control of industrial processes to reduce formation of dioxins as much as possible. This is the responsibility of national governments. The Codex Alimentarius Commission adopted a Code of Practice for Source Directed Measures to Reduce Contamination of Foods with Chemicals (CAC/RCP 49-2001) in 2001. In 2006 a Code of Practice for the Prevention and Reduction of Dioxin and Dioxin-like PCB Contamination in Food and Feeds (CAC/RCP 62-2006) was adopted.\nMore than 90% of human exposure to dioxins is through the food supply, mainly meat and dairy products, fish and shellfish. Therefore, protecting the food supply is critical. In addition to source-directed measures to reduce dioxin emissions, secondary contamination of the food supply needs to be avoided throughout the food chain. Good controls and practices during primary production, processing, distribution and sale are all essential in the production of safe food. Contaminated animal feed is often the root cause of food contamination.\nFood and feed contamination monitoring systems must be in place to ensure that tolerance levels are not exceeded. It is the responsibility of feed and food producers to assure safe raw materials and processes during production, and it is the role of national governments to monitor the safety of food supply and to take action to protect public health. When contamination is suspected, countries should have contingency plans to identify, detain and dispose of contaminated feed and food. The affected population should be examined for exposure (for example, measuring the contaminants in blood or human milk) and effects (for example, clinical surveillance to detect signs of ill health).\nTrimming fat from meat and consuming low fat dairy products may decrease the exposure to dioxin compounds. Also, a balanced diet (including adequate amounts of fruits, vegetables and cereals) will help to avoid excessive exposure from a single source. This is a long-term strategy to reduce body burdens and is probably most relevant for girls and young women to reduce exposure of the developing fetus and when breastfeeding infants later in life.

Some countries with CBHI schemes have taken action and transformed their CBHI model towards a national scheme.\nFor countries with established small-scale voluntary CBHI schemes, the government could capitalize on the positive results of improved local governance capacity and public acceptance of prepaid insurance contributions.

Being a global phenomenon that affects specific areas, it is a challenge for the health sector because of the difficulty in characterizing the exposure and the limited evidence on its long-term health effects. There is also a gap between health evidence in dust emitting regions and receptor regions, as desert dust events often involve long-range transport over great distances (>1000 km). Most of the health studies related to SDS events occur in high-income countries in receptor regions.\nCurrently, the response from governments is based on the knowledge of short terms health effects, limited early warning systems and the provision of information to vulnerable groups in real time, as well as the impact of emergency visits.\nSand and dust storms are also an important transboundary issue. Although staying close to the ground, mineral dust can travel considerable distances when lifted kilometres high into the atmosphere. Examples include dust from the Sahara frequently reaching the Caribbean and dust from inner northwest Asia often reaching the Korean Peninsula and Japan.\nGoing forward there is a need for strengthened collaboration between medical and environmental scientists to explore better exposure assessment, dust size fraction and specific chemical composition. The health sector should also address the gaps in knowledge and response on the health impacts of desert dust in the longer term and continue strengthening collaboration with appropriate government entities to provide a timely and effective public health response. Furthermore, collaborative and multi-country research \u2013 for both short- and long-term health impacts of SDS as well as the synergistic effects of both exposure to heat and particulate matter \u2013 is critical to protecting public health.\nStarting in 2023, theInternational Day of Combating Sand and Dust Stormswill be observed every year on 12 July."

Plans to improve newborn survival should be built on a strong foundation of essential newborn care and align with the Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) and Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality (EPMM) targets on antenatal care, postnatal care, skilled health personnel and emergency obstetric and newborn care. Increasing financing and allocating resources towards two very high-impact but high-cost interventions \u2013 care for small and sick newborns and emergency obstetric care \u2013 are critical, as these measures provide quadruple returns on investment by reducing maternal deaths, stillbirths, newborn deaths and both maternal and newborn morbidity. In settings with well-functioning midwife programmes, the provision of midwife-led continuity of care (MLCC) can reduce preterm births by up to 24%. MLCC is a model of care in which a midwife or a team of midwives provide care to the same woman throughout her pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period, calling upon medical support if necessary.\nWith the increase in facility births (almost 80% globally), there is a great opportunity for providing essential newborn care and identifying and managing high risk newborns. However, few women and newborns stay in the facility for the recommended 24 hours after birth, which is the most critical time when complications can present. In addition, too many newborns die at home because of early discharge from the hospital, barriers to access and delays in seeking care. The four recommended postnatal care contacts delivered at health facility or through home visits play a key role to reach these newborns and their families.\nAccelerated progress for neonatal survival and promotion of health and well-being requires strengthening quality of care as well as ensuring availability of quality health services or the small and sick newborn."

        "content": "Infertility may be caused by a number of different factors, in either the male or female reproductive systems. However, it is sometimes not possible to explain the causes of infertility.\nIn the female reproductive system, infertility may be caused by:\ntubal disorders such as blocked fallopian tubes, which are in turn caused by untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or complications of unsafe abortion, postpartum sepsis or abdominal/pelvic surgery;uterine disorders which could be inflammatory in nature (such as such endometriosis), congenital in nature (such as septate uterus), or benign in nature (such as fibroids);disorders of the ovaries, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and other follicular disorders;disorders of the endocrine system causing imbalances of reproductive hormones. The endocrine system includes hypothalamus and the pituitary glands. Examples of common disorders affecting this system include pituitary cancers and hypopituitarism.\nTherelative importance of these causesof female infertility may differ from country to country, for example due to differences in the background prevalence of STIs, or differing ages of populations studied.\nIn the male reproductive system, infertility may be caused by:\nobstruction of the reproductive tract causing dysfunctionalities in the ejection of semen. This blockage can occur in the tubes that carry semen (such as ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles). Blockages are commonly due to injuries or infections of the genital tract;hormonal disorders leading to abnormalities in hormones produced by the pituitary gland, hypothalamus and testicles \u2013 hormones such as testosterone regulate sperm production. Example of disorders that result in hormonal imbalance include pituitary or testicular cancers;testicular failure to produce sperm, for example due to varicoceles or medical treatments that impair sperm-producing cells (such as chemotherapy); andabnormal sperm function and quality. Conditions or situations that cause abnormal shape (morphology) and movement (motility) of the sperm negatively affect fertility. For example, the use of anabolic steroids can cause abnormal semen parameters such sperm count and shape(1).\nLifestyle factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol intake and obesity can affect fertility. In addition, exposure to environmental pollutants and toxins can be directly toxic to gametes (eggs and sperm), resulting in their decreased numbers and poor quality(1,2)."

Individuals and couples have the right to decide the number, timing and spacing of their children. Infertility can negate the realization of these essential human rights(3).\nA wide variety of people, including heterosexual couples, same-sex partners, older persons, individuals who are not in sexual relationships and those with certain medical conditions, such as some HIV sero-discordant couples and cancer survivors, may require infertility management and fertility care services. Inequities and disparities in access to fertility care services adversely affect the poor, unmarried, uneducated, unemployed and other marginalized populations.\nAddressing infertility can also mitigate gender inequality. Although both women and men can experience infertility, women in a relationship with a man are often perceived to suffer from infertility, regardless of whether they are infertile or not. Infertility has significant negative social impacts on the lives of infertile couples and particularly women, who frequently experience violence, divorce, social stigma, emotional stress, depression, anxiety and low self-esteem.\nIn some settings, fear of infertility can deter women and men from using contraception if they feel socially pressured to prove their fertility at an early age because of a high social value of childbearing.\u00a0 In such situations, education and awareness-raising interventions to address understanding of the prevalence and determinants of fertility and infertility is essential."

Diagnosis and treatment of infertility is often not prioritized in national population and development policies and reproductive health strategies and are rarely covered through public health financing. Moreover, a lack of trained personnel and the necessary equipment and infrastructure, and the currently high costs of treatment medicines, are major barriers even for countries that are actively addressing the needs of people with infertility.\nWhile assisted reproduction technologies (ART) have been available for more than three decades, with  millions of children born worldwide from ART interventions such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), these technologies are still largely unavailable, inaccessible and unaffordable in many parts of the world, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMIC).\nGovernment policies could mitigate the many inequities in access to safe and effective fertility care. To effectively address infertility, health policies need to recognize that infertility is a disease that can often be prevented, thereby mitigating the need for costly and poorly accessible treatments. Incorporating fertility awareness in national comprehensive sexuality education programmes, promoting healthy lifestyles to reduce behavioural risks, including prevention, diagnosis and early treatment of STIs, preventing complications of unsafe abortion, postpartum sepsis and abdominal/pelvic surgery, and addressing environmental toxins associated with infertility, are policy and programmatic interventions that all governments can implement.\nIn addition, enabling laws and policies that regulate third party reproduction and ART are essential to ensure universal access without discrimination and to protect and promote the human rights of all parties involved. Once fertility policies are in place, it is essential to ensure that their implementation is monitored, and the quality of services is continually improved."

Keeping bats away from sap collection sites with protective coverings\r\n        (such as bamboo sap skirts) may be helpful. Freshly collected date palm juice should be boiled, and fruits should be thoroughly washed and peeled before consumption.

As much as possible, people should avoid\r\n        being in contact with infected pigs. In endemic areas, when establishing new pig farms, considerations should be given to presence of fruit bats in the area and in general, pig feed and pig shed should be protected against bats when feasible.Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission.Close unprotected physical contact with Nipah virus-infected people should be avoided. Regular hand washing should be carried out after caring for or visiting sick people.\nHealth-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed infection, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions at all times\nAs human-to-human transmission has been reported, in particular in health-care settings, contact and droplet precautions should be used in addition to standard precautions.

Slaughtering, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings, are also likely to be risk factors. There is no evidence to suggest that A(H5), A(H7N9) or other avian influenza viruses can be transmitted to humans through properly prepared and cooked poultry or eggs. A few influenza A(H5N1) human cases have been linked to consumption of dishes made with raw contaminated poultry blood.\nIn 1997, human infections withA(H5N1)viruses were reported during an outbreak in poultry in Hong Kong SAR, China. Since 2003, this virus has spread in bird populations from Asia to Europe and Africa, and to the Americas in 2021, and has become endemic in poultry populations in many countries. Outbreaks have resulted in millions of poultry infections, several hundred human cases, and many human deaths. Human cases have been reported mostly from countries in Asia, but also from countries in Africa, the Americas and Europe.\nIn 2013, human infections withA(H7N9)viruses were reported for the first time in China.

Counselling and medication can more than double a tobacco user\u2019s chance of successful quitting.\nNational comprehensive cessation services with full or partial cost-coverage are available to assist tobacco users to quit in only 31 countries, representing a third of the world's population.\nMore on quitting tobacco\nHard-hitting anti-tobacco mass media campaigns and pictorial health warnings prevent children and other vulnerable groups from taking up tobacco use, and increase the number of tobacco users who quit.\nToday 62% of the world\u2019s population live in the 110 countries that meet best practice for graphic health warnings, which includes among other criteria, large (50% or more of the main areas of the package) pictorial health warnings displayed in the national language and rotating regularly.\n2.9 billion people live in the 36 countries that have aired at least one strong anti-tobacco mass media campaign within the last 2 years.\nMore on tobacco health warnings\nTobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship (TAPS) increases and sustains tobacco use by effectively recruiting new tobacco users and discouraging tobacco users from quitting.\nMore than one third of countries (68), representing over a quarter of the world\u2019s population, have completely banned all forms of TAPS.\nMore on tobacco advertising bans\nTobacco taxes are the most cost-effective way to reduce tobacco use, especially among youth and low-income groups. A tax increase that increases tobacco prices by 10% decreases tobacco consumption by about 4% in high-income countries and about 5% in low- and middle-income countries.\nEven so, high tobacco taxes are rarely implemented. Only 41 countries, with 12% of the world's population, have introduced taxes on tobacco products so that at least 75% of the retail price is tax.\nMore on tobacco taxes\nIllicit trade of tobacco products must be stopped\nThe illicit trade in tobacco products poses major health, economic and security concerns around the world. It is estimated that 1 in every 10 cigarettes and tobacco products consumed globally is illicit.\nExperience from many countries demonstrates that illicit trade can be successfully addressed even when tobacco taxes and prices are raised, resulting in increased tax revenues and reduced tobacco use.\nThe WHO FCTC Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade of Tobacco Products (ITP) is the key supply side policy to reduce tobacco use and its health and economic consequences.\nMore on eliminating the illicit trade of tobacco products\nNewer nicotine and tobacco products\nHeated tobacco products (HTPs) are tobacco products that produce aerosols containing nicotine and toxic chemicals upon heating of the tobacco, or activation of a device containing the tobacco. They contain the highly addictive substance nicotine, non-tobacco additives and are often flavoured.\nDespite claims of \u201crisk reduction\u201d, there is no evidence to demonstrate that HTPs are less harmful than conventional tobacco products. Many toxicants found in tobacco smoke are at significantly lower levels in HTP aerosol but HTP aerosol contains other toxicants found sometimes at higher levels than in tobacco smoke, such as glycidol, pyridine, dimethyl trisulfide, acetoin and methylglyoxal.\nFurther, some toxicants found in HTP aerosols are not found in conventional cigarette smoke and may have associated health effects. Additionally, these products are highly variable and some of the toxicants found in the emissions of these products are carcinogens.\nMore on heated tobacco products\nElectronic cigarettes (or e-cigarettes) are the most common form of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS) but there are others, such as e-cigars and e-pipes. ENDS contain varying amounts of nicotine and harmful emissions. Use of ENDS/ENNDS products is colloquially referred to as \u2018vaping\u2019. However this does not mean that they are harmless or emit water vapour.\nE-cigarette emissions typically contain nicotine and other toxic substances that are harmful to users and non-users who are exposed to the aerosols second-hand. Some products claiming to be nicotine-free have been found to contain nicotine.\nEvidence reveals that these products are harmful to health and are not safe. However, it is too early to provide a clear answer on the long-term impacts of using them or being exposed to them. Some recent studies suggest that ENDS use can increase the risk of heart disease and lung disorders.\u00a0Nicotine exposure in pregnant women can have negative health consequences on the fetus, and nicotine, which is a highly addictive substance is damaging for brain development.\nMore on e-cigarettes\nNicotine pouches are pre-portioned pouches that contain nicotine and are similar to traditional smokeless tobacco products such as snus in some respects including appearance, inclusion of nicotine and manner of use (placing them between the gum and lip). They are often promoted, as \u201ctobacco-free\u201d, which can be used anywhere and in some jurisdictions, such as the USA, they are referred to as \u201cwhite pouches\u201d.\nWHO response\nThere is a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict between the tobacco industry\u2019s interests and public health policy interests. The tobacco industry produces and promotes a product that has been proven scientifically to be addictive, to cause disease and death and to give rise to a variety of social ills, including increased poverty.\nThe scale of the human and economic tragedy that tobacco imposes is shocking, and also preventable. The tobacco industry is fighting to ensure the dangers of their products are concealed, but we are fighting back.\nThe WHO FCTC is a milestone in the promotion of public health. It is an evidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of people to the highest standard of health, provides legal dimensions for international health cooperation and sets high standards for compliance. Since its entry into force in 2005, the WHO FCTC has 182 Parties covering more than 90% of the world\u2019s population.\nIn 2007, WHO introduced a practical, cost-effective initiative to scale up implementation of the demand reduction provisions of the WHO FCTC, called MPOWER.\nThe 6 MPOWER measures are:\nMonitor tobacco use and prevention policies.Protect people from tobacco use.Offer help to quit tobacco use.Warn about the dangers of tobacco.Enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship.Raise taxes on tobacco.\nWHO has been monitoring MPOWER measures since 2007. For more details on progress made for tobacco control at global, regional and country level, please refer to the series ofWHO reports on the global tobacco epidemic.\nMore on MPOWER\n(1)Doll R, Peto R, Boreham J, Sutherland I.

        "heading": "Overview",
        "content": "Snake bite is a neglected public health issue in many tropical and subtropical countries. Most of these occur in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In Asia up to 2 million people are envenomed by snakes each year, while in Africa there are an estimated 435 000 to 580 000 snake bites annually that need treatment. Envenoming affects women, children and farmers in poor rural communities in low- and middle-income countries. The highest burden occurs in countries where health systems are weakest and medical resources sparse.\nBites by venomous snakes can cause acute medical emergencies involving severe paralysis that may prevent breathing, cause bleeding disorders that can lead to fatal haemorrhage, cause irreversible kidney failure and severe local tissue destruction that can cause permanent disability and limb amputation. Children may suffer more severe effects and can experience the effects more quickly than adults due to their smaller body mass.\nIn contrast to many other serious health conditions, a highly effective treatment exists. Most deaths and serious consequences of snake bites are entirely preventable by making safe and effective antivenoms more widely available and accessible. High quality snake antivenoms are the most effective treatment to prevent or reverse most of the venomous effects of snake bites. They are included in theWHO List of essential medicinesand should be part of any primary health care package where snake bites occur."

        "heading": "Challenges producing antivenoms",
        "content": "A significant challenge in manufacturing of antivenoms is the preparation of the correct immunogens (snake venoms). At present very few countries have capacity to produce snake venoms of adequate quality for antivenom manufacture, and many manufacturers rely on common commercial sources. These may not properly reflect the geographical variation that occurs in the venoms of some widespread species. In addition, lack of regulatory capacity for the control of antivenoms in countries with significant snake bite problems results in an inability to assess the quality and appropriateness of the antivenoms.\nA combination of factors has led to the present crisis. Poor data on the number and type of snake bites have led to difficulty in estimating needs, and deficient distribution policies have further contributed to manufacturers reducing or stopping production or increasing the prices of antivenoms. Weak regulation and the marketing of inappropriate or poor quality antivenoms has also resulted in a loss of confidence in some of the available antivenoms by clinicians, health managers and patients, which has further eroded demand."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Weak health systems and lack of data",
        "content": "A combination of strategic and risk-based placement of antivenoms, suitable healthcare staff training, availability of affordable, safe and effective antivenoms and equipment, along with the promotion of responsible health-seeking behaviours, can lead better outcomes for snakebite patients and a considerable reduction in the impact of snakebite-related morbidity and mortality. However, the combination of poor geographical access to and inadequate health services in remote communities hinders the chance of receiving appropriate treatment.\nHealth systems in many countries where snake bites are common often lack the infrastructure and resources to collect robust statistical data on the problem. Assessing the true impact is further complicated by the fact that cases reported to health ministries by clinics and hospitals are often only a small proportion of the actual burden because many victims never reach primary care facilities and are therefore unreported. This is contributed to by socio-economic and cultural factors that influence treatment-seeking behaviour with many victims opting for traditional practices rather than hospital care.\nUnder-reporting of snake bite incidence and mortality is common. In Nepal, for example, where 90% of the population lives in rural areas, the Ministry of Health reported 480 snake bites resulting in 22 deaths for the year 2000 yet figures for the same year collected in a community-based study of one region (eastern Nepal) detailed 4078 bites and 396 deaths(1). Likewise, a very large community level study of snakebite deaths in India gave a direct estimate of 45 900 (99% CI: 40 900\u201350 900) deaths in 2005, which is over 30 times higher than the Government of India\u2019s official figure(2). Revised estimates based on verbal autopsies and other data now suggest that as many as 1.2 million Indians died from snakebite envenoming between 2000\u20132019 (average of 58 000/year)(3). A comparison of hospital-registered deaths in one district of Sri Lanka to data from the Registrar-General\u2019s office on deaths demonstrated that 62.5% of deaths from snakebite envenoming were not reported in hospital data(4).\nIn situations where data on snakebite envenoming are poor, it is difficult to accurately determine the need for antivenoms. This leads to under-estimation of antivenom needs by national health authorities driving down demand for manufacturers to produce antivenom products, and for some, their departure from the market. The weaknesses in some regulatory systems that leads to licensing of ineffective or incorrect products is sometimes coupled to poor procurement practices and inefficient distribution strategies, further hindering access to antivenoms and creating shortages of safe, affordable and effective products."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Low production of antivenoms",
        "content": "Given low demand, several manufacturers have ceased production, and the price of some antivenom products have dramatically increased in the last 20 years, making treatment unaffordable for the majority of those who need it. Rising prices also further suppress demand, to the extent that antivenom availability has declined significantly or even disappeared in some areas. The entry into some markets of inappropriate, untested, or even fake antivenom products has also undermined confidence in antivenom therapy generally.\nMany believe that unless strong and decisive action is taken quickly, antivenom supply failure is imminent in Africa and in some countries in Asia."

        "heading": "WHO response",
        "content": "WHO has taken steps to raise the awareness of health authorities and policy makers on this issue. In December 2015 a programme to evaluate the potential safety and effectiveness of current antivenom products intended for use in sub-Saharan Africa was launched by WHO. This process has subsequently been extended to WHO South-East Asia and to the Eastern Mediterranean Regions. The results of this detailed technical and laboratory assessment provide regulators and procurement agencies with informed guidance on which antivenoms best suit their needs. Following a request by several UN member states, WHO formally listed snakebite envenoming as a highest priority neglected tropical disease in June 2017.\nASnakebite Envenoming Working Groupestablished that same year was tasked with informing the development of a strategic WHO road map on snakebites. This strategy focuses on a 50% reduction in mortality and disability caused by snakebite envenoming by 2030. This aim will be achieved through four key objectives:\nempower and engage communitiesensure safe, effective treatmentstrengthen health systemsincrease partnerships, coordination and resources.\nA primer on the WHO response was published in the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases in February 2019(5).\nWHO is working closely with a range of partners to ensure the successful implementation of the road map. The strategy focuses on activities in countries and regions where snakebite envenoming occurs, supported by technical units from WHO. A number of large capacity building projects have already been launched. Particular attention is being focused on the development of a community engagement toolkit(6), specific interventions to improve access to WHO-recommended antivenoms(7), strengthen regulation and control of antivenom products and inform rational evidence-based design (link), improved data collection and analysis (link), estimate snake distribution and the risk of snakebite incidence among vulnerable populations using high-resolution geospatial models(8), and integration of snakebite envenoming into the national health plans of affected countries.\nWHO urges regulators, producers, researchers, clinicians, national and regional health authorities, and international and community organizations to work together to improve the availability of reliable epidemiological data on snake bites, the regulatory control of antivenoms and their distribution policies.\nTwo tools to help guide the development of appropriate antivenoms and their strategic placement have been launched:\nGuidelines for the production, control, and regulation of snake antivenoms immunoglobulinsPublic benefit target product profiles for snake antivenom in sub-Saharan AfricaSnakebite Information and Data Platform (SIDP)\nThese tools will assist:\nPublic health officials in      determining what antivenoms are needed in their country and in drafting      relevant national public health policies;National regulators in      prioritizing antivenoms for registration and assessing safety, quality,      and efficacy of antivenoms to meet national public health needs;Procurement agencies in      selecting appropriate antivenoms for national treatment needs;Antivenom manufacturers in      developing plans for production and sale of appropriate antivenoms;Clinicians and health care      professionals in treating snakebites; andGeneral population in knowing      and being able to identify which venomous snakes live in their area.\nReferences\n1.Sharma SK.

On a global scale, the indirect cost of harm amounts to trillions of US dollars each year (1).\nInvestment in reducing patient harm can lead to significant financial savings, and more importantly better patient outcomes (5).

        "content": "Medication errors.Medication-related harm affects 1 out of every 30 patients in health care, with more than a quarter of this harm regarded as severe or life threatening. Half of the avoidable harm in health care is related to medications(3).\nSurgical errors.Over 300\u00a0million surgical procedures are performed each year worldwide(6). Despite awareness of adverse effects, surgical errors continue to occur at a high rate; 10% of preventable patient harm in health care was reported in surgical settings(2), with most of the resultant adverse events occurring pre- and post-surgery(7).\nHealth care-associated infections.With a global rate of 0.14% (increasing by 0.06% each year), health care-associated infections result in extended duration of hospital stays, long-standing disability, increased antimicrobial resistance, additional financial burden on patients, families and health systems, and avoidable deaths(8).\nSepsis.Sepsis is a serious condition that happens when the body\u2019s immune system has an extreme response to an infection. The body\u2019s reaction causes damage to its own tissues and organs. Of all sepsis cases managed in hospitals, 23.6% were found to be health care associated, and approximately 24.4% of affected patients lost their lives as a result(9).\nDiagnostic errors.These occur in 5\u201320% of physician\u2013patient encounters(10,11). According to doctor reviews, harmful diagnostic errors were found in a minimum of 0.7% of adult admissions(12). Most people will suffer a diagnostic error in their lifetime(13).\nPatient falls.Patient falls are the most frequent adverse events in hospitals(14). Their rate of occurrence ranges from 3 to 5 per 1000 bed-days, and more than one third of these incidents result in injury(15), thereby reducing clinical outcomes and increasing the financial burden on systems(16).\nVenous thromboembolism.More simply known as blood clots, venous thromboembolism is a highly burdensome and preventable cause of patient harm, which contributes to one third of the complications attributed to hospitalization(17).\nPressure ulcers.Pressure ulcers are injuries to the skin or soft tissue. They develop from pressure to particular parts of the body over an extended period. If not promptly managed, they can have fatal complications. Pressure ulcers affect more than 1 in 10 adult patients admitted to hospitals(18)and, despite being highly preventable, they have a significant impact on the mental and physical health of individuals, and their quality of life.\nUnsafe transfusion practices.Unnecessary transfusions and unsafe transfusion practices expose patients to the risk of serious adverse transfusion reactions and transfusion-transmissible infections.Dataon adverse transfusion reactions from a group of 62 countries show an average incidence of 12.2 serious reactions per 100\u00a0000 distributed blood components.\nPatient misidentification.Failure to correctly identify patients can be a root cause of many problems and has serious effects on health care provision. It can lead to catastrophic adverse effects, such as wrong-site surgery. A report of the Joint Commission published in 2018 identified 409 sentinel events of patient identification out of 3326 incidents (12.3%) between 2014 and 2017(19).\nUnsafe injection practices.Each year, 16\u00a0billion injections are administered worldwide, and unsafe injection practices place patients and health and care workers at risk of infectious and non-infectious adverse events. Using mathematical modelling, a study estimated that, in a period of 10 years (2000\u20132010), 1.67 million hepatitis B virus infections, between 157\u00a0592 and 315\u00a0120 hepatitis C virus infections, and between 16\u00a0939 and 33\u00a0877 HIV infections were associated with unsafe injections(20)."

In this, errors are attributed to poorly designed system structures and processes, and the human nature of all those working in health care facilities under a considerable amount of stress in complex and quickly changing environments is recognized. This is done without overlooking negligence or misbehaviour from those providing care that leads to substandard medical management.\nA safe health system is one that adopts all necessary measures to avoid and reduce harm through organized activities, including:\nensuring leadership commitment to safety and creation of a culture whereby safety is prioritized;ensuring a safe working environment and the safety of procedures and clinical processes;building competencies of health and care workers and improving teamwork and communication;engaging patients and families in policy development, research and shared decision-making; andestablishing systems for patient safety incident reporting for learning and continuous improvement.\nInvesting in patient safetypositively impacts health outcomes, reduces costs related to patient harm, improves system efficiency, and helps in reassuring communities and restoring their trust in health care systems(4,5)."

Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually one to three days, with a maximum of nine days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually five to six days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.\nOnset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After two to four days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).\nOther clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena. There is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, sudden liver failure or pulmonary failure after the fifth day of illness.\nThe mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the second week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the ninth or tenth day after the onset of illness."

Photo:Robert Swanepoel/NICD South Africa\nIt is difficultto prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent. Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities.\nFor example, following an outbreak at an ostrich abattoir in South Africa (noted above), measures were taken to ensure that ostriches remained tick free for 14 days in a quarantine station before slaughter. This decreased the risk for the animal to be infected during its slaughtering and prevented human infection for those in contact with the livestock.\nThere are no vaccines available for use in animals.\nAlthough an inactivated, mouse brain-derived vaccine against CCHF has been developed and used on a small scale in eastern Europe, there is currently no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use.\nIn the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus.\nPublic health advice should focus on several aspects.\nReducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission:wear protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers);wear light coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks on the clothes;use approved acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) on clothing;use approved repellent on the skin and clothing;regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks; if found, remove them safely;seek to eliminate or control tick infestations on animals or in stables and barns; andavoid areas where ticks are abundant and seasons when they are most active.Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission:wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues in endemic areas, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home;quarantine animals before they enter slaughterhouses or routinely treat animals with pesticides two weeks prior to slaughter.Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community:avoid close physical contact with CCHF-infected people;wear gloves and protective equipment when taking care of ill people;wash hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people.\nwear protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers);wear light coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks on the clothes;use approved acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) on clothing;use approved repellent on the skin and clothing;regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks; if found, remove them safely;seek to eliminate or control tick infestations on animals or in stables and barns; andavoid areas where ticks are abundant and seasons when they are most active.\nwear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues in endemic areas, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home;quarantine animals before they enter slaughterhouses or routinely treat animals with pesticides two weeks prior to slaughter.\navoid close physical contact with CCHF-infected people;wear gloves and protective equipment when taking care of ill people;wash hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people.\nHealth-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and safe burial practices.\nAs a precautionary measure, health-care workers caring for patients immediately outside the CCHF outbreak area should also implement standard infection control precautions.\nSamples taken from people with suspected CCHF should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.\nRecommendations for infection control while providing care to patients with suspected or confirmed Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever should follow those developed by WHO for Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fever."

This can be done by liver biopsy or through a variety of non-invasive tests. The degree of liver damage is used to guide treatment decisions and management of the disease.\nEarly diagnosis can prevent health problems that may result from infection and prevent transmission of the virus. WHO recommends testing people who may be at increased risk of infection.\nIn settings with high HCV antibody seroprevalence in the general population (defined as>2% or>5% HCV antibody seroprevalence), WHO also recommends blood donor screening, as well as focused or targeted testing of specific high-risk groups, including migrants from endemic regions, health-care workers, people who inject drugs (PWID), people in prisons and other closed settings, men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers and HIV-infected persons.\nWHO recommends that all adults have access to and be offered HCV testing with linkage to prevention, care and treatment services.\nAbout 2.3\u00a0million people of the estimated 39 million living with HIV globally have serological evidence of past or present HCV infection.

The goal of treatment is to cure the disease and prevent long-term liver damage.\nAntiviral medications, including sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, are used to treat hepatitis C. Some people's immune system can fight the infection on their own and new infections do not always need treatment. Treatment is always needed for chronic hepatitis C.\nPeople with hepatitis C may also benefit from lifestyle changes, such as avoiding alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight. With proper treatment, many people can be cured from hepatitis C infection and live healthy lives.\nWHO recommends therapy with pan-genotypic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for all adults, adolescents and children down to 3 years of age with chronic hepatitis C infection. The short-course oral, curative DAA treatment regimens has few if any side-effects. DAAs can cure most persons with HCV infection, and treatment duration is short (usually 12 to 24 weeks), depending on the absence or presence of cirrhosis. In 2022, WHO included new recommendations for treatment of adolescents and children using the same pangenotypic treatments used for adults.\nPan-genotypic DAAs remain expensive in many high- and upper-middle-income countries. However, prices have dropped dramatically in many countries (primarily low-income and lower-middle-income countries) due to the introduction of generic versions of these medicines. The most widely used and low-cost pangenotypic DAA regimen is sofosbuvir and daclatasvir. In many low- and middle-income countries the curative treatment course is available for less than US$\u00a050.\nAccess to HCV treatment is improving but remains limited. Of the 50\u00a0million people living with HCV infection globally in 2022, an estimated 36% people knew their diagnosis, and of those diagnosed with chronic HCV infection, around 20% (12.5\u00a0million) people had been treated with DAAs by the end of 2022."

It does so by working\r\n    with the person and their family to address underlying health conditions and their symptoms, modifying their environment to better suit their needs, using assistive products, educating to strengthen self-management, and adapting tasks so that they\r\n    can be performed more safely and independently. Together, these strategies can help an individual; overcome difficulties with thinking, seeing, hearing, communicating, eating or moving around.\nAnybody may need rehabilitation at some point in their lives, following an injury, surgery, disease or illness, or because their functioning has declined with age.\nSome examples of rehabilitation include:\nspeech and language training to improve a person\u2019s communication after a brain injury;physical exercise training to improve muscle strength, voluntary movements and balance in persons with stroke or Parkinson disease;modifying an older person\u2019s home environment to improve their safety and independence at home and to reduce their risk of falls;educating a person with heart disease on how to exercise safely;preparing a person with an amputation to be able to use a prosthetic and making, fitting and refitting the prosthesis;positioning and splinting techniques to assist with skin healing, reduce swelling, and to regain movement after burn surgery;prescribing medicine to reduce spasticity for a child with cerebral palsy;psychological therapies for a person with emotional distress following a spinal cord injury;Social skills training for persons with schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders or disorders of intellectual disability.training a person with vision loss in the use of a white cane; andworking with a patient in intensive care to improve their breathing, prevent complications and speed their recovery after critical illness\nRehabilitation is highly person-centred, meaning that the interventions selected for each individual are targeted to their goals and preferences. Rehabilitation can be provided in many different places, such as inpatient or outpatient hospital settings,\r\n    outpatient physio- or occupational therapy practices, and community settings such as an individual\u2019s home, a school or a workplace.\nThe rehabilitation workforce is made up of different health workers, including but not limited to physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and audiologists, orthotists and prosthetists, clinical psychologists, physical\r\n    medicine\u00a0and\u00a0rehabilitation doctors,\u00a0and rehabilitation nurses.

In addition, rehabilitation can help to prevent, reduce or manage complications associated with many health conditions, such as in the context of spinal cord injury, stroke, or fractures.\nRehabilitation helps to minimize or slow down the disabling effects of chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes by equipping people with self-management strategies and the assistive products they require, or by addressing\r\n    pain or other complications. As such, it contributes to healthy ageing.\nRehabilitation is an investment, with cost benefits for both the individuals and society. It can help to avoid costly hospitalization, reduce hospital length of stay, and prevent re-admissions. As rehabilitation also enables individuals to engage in or\r\n    return to work and employment, or to remain independent at home, it minimizes the need for financial or caregiver support.\nRehabilitation is an important part of universal health coverage and is a key strategy for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 \u2013 \u201cEnsure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\u201d."

Improvements to health services coverage have stagnated since 2015, and the proportion of the population that faced catastrophic levels of out-of-pocket health spending increased continuously since 2000. This global pattern is consistent across all regions and the majority of countries.The UHC service coverage index increased from 45 to 68 between 2000 and 2021. However, recent progress in increasing coverage has slowed compared to pre-2015 gains, rising only 3 index points between 2015 and 2021 and showing no change since 2019.The proportion of the population not covered by essential health services decreased by about 15% between 2000 and 2021, with minimal progress made after 2015. This indicates that in 2021, about 4.5 billion people were not fully covered by essential health services.About 2 billion people are facing financial hardship including 1 billion experiencing catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending (SDG indicator 3.8.2) or 344 million people going deeper into extreme poverty due to health costs.The COVID-19 pandemic further disrupted essential services in 92% of countries at the height of the pandemic in 2021. In 2022, 84% of countries still reported disruptions.To build back better, WHO\u2019s recommendation is to reorient health systems using a primary health care (PHC) approach.Scaling up PHC interventions across low and middle-income countries could save 60 million lives and increase average life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030."

It covers the full continuum of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care across the life course.\nThe delivery of these services requires health and care workers with an optimal skills mix at all levels of the health system, who are equitably distributed, adequately supported with access to quality assured products, and enjoying decent work.\nProtecting people from the financial consequences of paying for health services out of their own pockets reduces the risk that people will be pushed into poverty because the cost of needed services and treatments requires them to use up their life savings, sell assets, or borrow \u2013 destroying their futures and often those of their children.\nAchieving UHC is one of the targets the nations of the world set when they adopted the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. At the United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on UHC in 2019, countries reaffirmed that health is a precondition for and an outcome and indicator of the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. WHO\u2019s Thirteenth General Programme of Work aims to have 1 billion more people benefit from UHC by 2025, while also contributing to the targets of 1 billion more people better protected from health emergencies and 1 billion more people enjoying better health and well-being."

        "content": "Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, progress towards UHC was already faltering. The impressive pace of progress in expanding service coverage prior to 2015 did not continue as the UHC service coverage index (SDG indicator 3.8.1) increased only 3 points to 68 by 2019 and stagnated at this level through 2021. This indicates that in 2021, about 4.5 billion people were not fully covered by essential health services. \u00a0The portion of the population incurring catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending (SDG 3.8.2) increased continuously from 9.6% in 2000 to 13.5% in 2019 when it surpassed 1 billion people. Moreover, in 2019, out-of-pocket health spending dragged 344 million people further into extreme poverty and 1.3 billion into relative poverty. In total, in 2019, 2 billion people faced any form of financial hardship (catastrophic, impoverishing or both).\nThe global pattern of the recent stagnating progress in service coverage while catastrophic health spending increases continuously is consistent across all regions, country income groups and most countries at all income levels.\nInequalities continue to be a fundamental challenge for UHC. Even where there is national progress on health service coverage, the aggregate data mask inequalities within-countries. For example, coverage of reproductive, maternal, child and adolescent health services tends to be higher among those who are richer, more educated, and living in urban areas, especially in low-income countries. On financial hardship, catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending is more prevalent among people living in households with older members (age 60 years or over). People living in poorer households, rural areas and in households with older family members (those aged 60 and older) are more likely to be further dragged into poverty by out-of-pocket health spending.\u00a0Monitoring health inequalities is essential to identify and track disadvantaged populations to provide decision-makers with an evidence base to formulate more equity-oriented policies, programmes and practices towards the progressive realization of UHC. Better data are also needed on gender inequalities, socioeconomic disadvantages, and specific issues faced by indigenous peoples and refugee and migrant populations displaced by conflict and economic and environmental crises.\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, essential services were disrupted in 92% of countries. In 2022, 84% of countries still reported disruptions. In 2021, some 25 million children under 5 years missed out on routine immunization. There were glaring disparities in access to COVID-19 vaccines, with an average of 34% of the population vaccinated in low-income countries compared to almost 73% in high-income countries as of June 2023. Potentially life-saving emergency, critical and operative care interventions also showed increased service disruptions, likely resulting in significant near-term impact on health outcomes.\nAs a foundation for and way to move towards UHC, WHO recommends reorienting health systems using a primary health care (PHC) approach. PHC is the most inclusive, equitable, cost-effective and efficient approach to enhance people\u2019s physical and mental health, as well as social well-being. It enables universal, integrated access to health services as close as possible to people\u2019s everyday environments. It also helps deliver the full range of quality services and products that people need for health and well-being, thereby improving coverage and financial protection. Significant cost efficiencies can be achieved and most (90%) essential UHC interventions can be delivered through a PHC approach. Some 75% of the projected health gains from the SDGs could also be realized through PHC, including saving over 60 million lives and increasing average global life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030.\nStrengthening health systems based on PHC should result in measurable health impact in countries."

The larvae then migrate to the lymphatic vessels where they develop into adult worms, thus continuing a cycle of transmission.\nLymphatic filariasis is transmitted by different types of mosquitoes, for example by theCulexmosquito, widespread across urban and semi-urban areas,Anopheles, mainly found in rural areas, andAedes, mainly in endemic islands in the Pacific."

Involvement of breasts and genital organs is common. Such body deformities often lead to social stigma and sub-optimal mental health, loss of income-earning opportunities and increased medical expenses for patients and their caretakers. The socioeconomic burdens of isolation and poverty are immense.\nAcute episodes of local inflammation involving skin, lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels often accompany chronic lymphoedema or elephantiasis. Some of these episodes are caused by the body's immune response to the parasite. Most are the result of secondary bacterial skin infection where normal defenses have been partially lost due to underlying lymphatic damage.

The medicines used have a limited effect on adult parasites but effectively reduce the density of microfilariae in the bloodstream and prevent the spread of parasites to mosquitoes.\nThe MDA regimen recommended depends on the co-endemicity of lymphatic filariasis with other filarial diseases. WHO recommends the following MDA regimens:\nalbendazole (400\u00a0mg) alone twice per year for areas co-endemic with loiasis;ivermectin (200\u00a0mcg/kg) with albendazole (400\u00a0mg) in countries with onchocerciasis;\ndiethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) (6\u00a0mg/kg) and albendazole (400 mg) in countries without onchocerciasis; and\nivermectin (200\u00a0mcg/kg) together with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) (6\u00a0mg/kg) and albendazole (400 mg) in countries without onchocerciasis and where other programmatic conditions are met.\nThe impact of MDA depends on the efficacy of the regimen and the coverage (proportion of total population ingesting the medicines). MDA with the 2-medicine regimens have interrupted the transmission cycle when conducted annually for at least 4\u20136 years with effective coverage of the total population at risk. Salt fortified with DEC has also been used in a few unique settings to interrupt the transmission cycle.\nAt the start of GPELF, 81 countries were considered endemic for lymphatic filariasis. Further epidemiological data reviewed since, indicate that preventive chemotherapy was not required in 10 countries. From 2000 to 2023, 9.7\u00a0billion cumulative treatments were delivered to more than 943 million people at least once in 71 countries, considerably reducing transmission in many places. The population requiring MDA has declined by 58.6% (871\u00a0million) where infection prevalence has been reduced below elimination thresholds.\u00a0The overall economic benefit of the programme during 2000\u20132007 is conservatively estimated at US$\u00a024\u00a0billion. Treatments until 2015 are estimated to have averted at least US$\u00a0100.5\u00a0billion of economic loss expected to have occurred over the lifetime of cohorts who have benefited from treatment.\nTwenty-one countries and territories (Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, the Cook Islands, Egypt, Kiribati, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Malawi, Marshall Islands, Niue, Palau, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Vanuatu, Viet Nam, Wallis and Futuna, and Yemen) are now acknowledged as achieving elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. By 2023, 14 countries had successfully implemented recommended strategies, stopped large-scale treatment and are under surveillance to demonstrate that elimination has been achieved. Preventive chemotherapy is still required in 39 countries and within 6 of these countries MDA has not yet been delivered to all endemic areas as of the end of 2023."

It is sometimes preceded by a short lasting aura of unilateral, reversable visual, sensory or other symptoms.\nMigraine most often begins at puberty and generally affects those aged between 35 and 45 years. It is more common in women, possibly because of hormonal influences. Children typically experience migraine of shorter duration and abdominal symptoms are usually more prominent.\nThe exact cause of migraine is currently unknown but it is thought to result from the release of pain producing inflammatory substances around the nerves and blood vessels of the head. It can be triggered by alcohol and certain foods.\nMigraine is characterized by recurring attacks and is often life-long.\nAttacks typically include:\nheadache, which isof moderate or severe intensityone-sided or behind the eyepulsating in qualityaggravated by routine physical activitywith duration of hours to 2\u20133 days;sensitivity to light and sounds; andnausea.\nTension-type headaches (TTH) are described as pressure or tightness, often like a band around the head, sometimes spreading into or from the neck. They may be stress-related or associated with musculoskeletal problems in the neck. They often begin during the teenage years and affect 50% more woman than men.\nEpisodic TTH, occurring on fewer than 15 days per month, is reported by more than 70% of some populations. Episodic TTH attacks usually last a few hours but can persist for several days.\nChronic TTH can be unremitting and is more disabling than episodic TTH.\nCluster headache (CH) is a primary headache disorder characterized by frequently recurring (up to several times a day), brief but extremely severe headache, usually focused in or around one eye, with tearing and redness of the eye. The nose often runs or is blocked on the affected side and the eyelid may droop.\nCH is relatively uncommon affecting fewer than 1 in 1000 adults, affecting six men to each woman. Most people developing CH are in their 20s or older. CH has episodic and chronic forms.\nMedication-overuse headaches (MOH) are caused by chronic and excessive use of medication to treat headache. MOH is the most common secondary headache disorder.\nIt may affect up to 5% of some populations, women more than men. MOH occurs by definition on more days than not, is oppressive, persistent and often at its worst on awakening."

Significant improvements can be made in the lives of cancer patients by\r\n    detecting cancer early and avoiding delays in care.\nEarly diagnosis consists of three components:\nbeing aware of the symptoms of different forms of cancer and of the importance of seeking medical advice when abnormal findings are observed;access to clinical evaluation and diagnostic services; andtimely referral to treatment services.\nEarly diagnosis of symptomatic cancers is relevant in all settings and the majority of cancers. Cancer programmes should be designed to reduce delays in, and barriers to, diagnosis, treatment and supportive care.\nScreening aims to identify individuals with findings suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer before they have developed symptoms. When abnormalities are identified during screening, further tests to establish a definitive diagnosis should follow,\r\n    as should referral for treatment if cancer is proven to be present.\nScreening programmes are effective for some but not all cancer types and in general are far more complex and resource-intensive than early diagnosis as they require special equipment and dedicated personnel. Even when screening programmes are established,\r\n    early diagnosis programmes are still necessary to identify those cancer cases occurring in people who do not meet the age or risk factor criteria for screening.\nPatient selection for screening programmes is based on age and risk factors to avoid excessive false positive studies.

Proper selection of a treatment regimen takes into consideration both the cancer and the individual being treated. Completion of the treatment protocol in a defined period of time is important to achieve the predicted\r\n    therapeutic result.\nDetermining the goals of treatment is an important first step. The primary goal is generally to cure cancer or to considerably prolong life. Improving the patient's quality of life is also an important goal. This can be achieved by support for the patient\u2019s\r\n    physical, psychosocial and spiritual well-being and palliative care in terminal stages of cancer.\nSome of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, and colorectal cancer, have high cure probabilities when detected early and treated according to best practices.\nSome cancer types, such as testicular seminoma and different types of leukaemia and lymphoma in children, also have high cure rates if appropriate treatment is provided, even when cancerous cells are present in other areas of the body.\nThere is, however, a significant variation in treatment availability between countries of different income levels; comprehensive treatment is reportedly available in more than 90% of high-income countries but less than 15% of low-income countries (3)."

El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a are the oceanic components, while the Southern Oscillation is the atmospheric counterpart, thus giving rise to the term El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO occurs in irregular cycles of 2\u20137 years and presents 3 phases: El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a and a neutral phase. An El Ni\u00f1o event is characterized by a period of sea-surface warming and consequent suppression of the nutrient-rich cold water up-welling off the coast of Peru and Ecuador, typically lasting between 12 and 18 months. In contrast, a La Ni\u00f1a event is characterized by a period of colder than average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean and an intensification of the prevailing east to west surface winds."

Small changes in climate conditions in these areas have the potential to change normally unsuitable habitats into viable habitats for mosquitoes that transmit malaria, or to temporarily extend the period of malaria susceptibility. The effect of ENSO on malaria is mediated by its impact on rainfall and temperature patterns. In dry areas, intense rainfall can create water puddles; in wet areas, drought can result in reservoirs of stagnant water, both of which are conducive to generation of new mosquito breeding sites. Decreased immunity acquired over time by inhabitants of these new malaria-prone areas can further increase the risk of outbreaks. Evidence of the association between ENSO and malaria has been found in southern Africa, South Asia and South America."

During 2000\u20132013, estimated measles deaths decreased by 74% from 481 000 to 124 000.\nDespite a significant reduction in the number of maternal deaths \u2013 from an estimated 523 000 in 1990 to 289 000 in 2013 \u2013 the rate of decline is less than half of what is needed to achieve the MDG target of a three quarters reduction in the mortality ratio between 1990 and 2015.\nTo reduce the number of maternal deaths, women need access to good-quality reproductive health care and effective interventions. In 2012, 64% of women aged 15\u201349 years who were married or in a consensual union were using some form of contraception, while 12% wanted to stop or postpone childbearing but were not using contraception.\nThe proportion of women receiving antenatal care at least once during pregnancy was about 83% for the period 2007\u20132014, but for the recommended minimum of 4 or more visits the corresponding figure drops to around 64%.\nThe proportion of births attended by skilled personnel \u2013 crucial for reducing perinatal, neonatal and maternal deaths \u2013 is above 90% in 3 of the 6 WHO regions. However, increased coverage is needed in certain regions, such as the WHO African Region where the figure was still only 51%.\nIn 2013 an estimated 2.1 million people were newly infected with HIV \u2013 down from 3.4 million in 2001. By the end of 2013 about 12.9 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally. Of these, 11.7 million lived in low- and middle-income countries, representing 36% of the estimated 32.6 million people living with HIV in these countries. Should current trends continue the target of placing 15 million people on ART by 2015 will be exceeded.\nThe decrease in the number of those newly infected along with the increased availability of ART have contributed to a major decline in HIV mortality levels \u2013 from 2.4 million people in 2005 to an estimated 1.5 million in 2013. As fewer people die from AIDS-related causes the number of people living with HIV is likely to continue to grow.\nAbout half the world\u2019s population is at risk of malaria, and an estimated 198 million cases in 2013 led to approximately 584 000 deaths \u2013 most of these in children under the age of 5 living in Africa.\nDuring the period 2000\u20132013, malaria incidence and mortality rates of population at risk have both fallen globally, 30% and 47% respectively.\nThe coverage of interventions such as the distribution of insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying has greatly increased, and will need to be sustained in order to prevent the resurgence of disease and deaths caused by malaria. Globally, the MDG target of halting by 2015 and beginning to reverse the incidence of malaria has already been met.\nThe annual global number of new cases of tuberculosis has been slowly falling for a decade thus achieving MDG target 6.C to reverse the spread of the disease by 2015. In 2013, there were an estimated 9 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths (including 360 000 deaths among HIV-positive people).\nGlobally, treatment success rates have been sustained at high levels since 2007, at or above the target of 85%. However, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), which emerged primarily as a result of inadequate treatment, continues to pose problems.\nMDG Target 6.C also includes neglected tropical diseases \u2013 a medically diverse group of infectious conditions caused by a variety of pathogens.\nIn 2013 only 6314 cases of human African trypanosomiasis were reported, representing the lowest levels of recorded cases in 50 years. This disease is now targeted for elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Dracunculiasis is also on the verge of eradication with an historic low of 126 cases reported in 2014 and an ongoing WHO target of interrupting its transmission by the end of 2015.\nPlans to eliminate leprosy as a public health problem worldwide by 2020 have also been prepared and are being implemented. The elimination of visceral leishmaniasis as a public health problem in the Indian subcontinent by 2020 is on track with a greater than 75% reduction in incident cases recorded since the launch of the programme in 2005. In the case of lymphatic filariasis, more than 5 billion treatments have been delivered since 2000 to stop its spread and of the 73 known endemic countries 39 are on track to achieve its elimination as a public health problem by 2020.\nThe world has now met the MDG target relating to access to safe drinking-water. In 2012, 90% of the population used an improved source of drinking-water compared with 76% in 1990. Progress has however been uneven across different regions, between urban and rural areas, and between rich and poor.\nWith regard to basic sanitation, current rates of progress are too slow for the MDG target to be met globally. In 2012, 2.5 billion people did not have access to improved sanitation facilities, with 1 billion these people still practicing open defecation. The number of people living in urban areas without access to improved sanitation is increasing because of rapid growth in the size of urban populations.\nMany people continue to face a scarcity of medicines in the public sector, forcing them to the private sector where prices can be substantially higher. Surveys undertaken from 2007-2013 show the average availability of selected generic medicines in 21 low- and middle-income countries was only 55% in the public sector.\nEven the lowest-priced generics can put common treatments beyond the reach of low-income households in developing countries. The greatest price is paid by patients suffering chronic diseases. Effective treatments for the majority of the global chronic disease burden exist, yet universal access remains out-of-reach."

Natural presence of chemicals, particularly in groundwater, can also be of health significance, including arsenic and fluoride, while other chemicals, such as lead, may be elevated in drinking-water as a result of leaching from water supply components in contact with drinking-water.\nSome 1\u00a0million people are estimated to die each year from diarrhoea as a result of unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hand hygiene. Yet diarrhoea is largely preventable, and the deaths of 395\u00a0000 children aged under 5 years could be avoided each year if these risk factors were addressed. Where water is not readily available, people may decide handwashing is not a priority, thereby adding to the likelihood of diarrhoea and other diseases.\nDiarrhoea is the most widely known disease linked to contaminated food and water but there are other hazards. In 2021, over 251.4\u00a0million people required preventative treatment for schistosomiasis \u2013 an acute and chronic disease caused by parasitic worms contracted through exposure to infested water."

Over 2\u00a0billion people live in water-stressed countries, which is expected to be exacerbated in some regions as result of climate change and population growth. Re-use of wastewater to recover water, nutrients or energy is becoming an important strategy. Use of wastewater and sludge is widespread globally; however, much is used informally and/or without sufficient treatment and other controls to ensure that human and environmental health is protected. If done appropriately safe use of wastewater and sludge can yield multiple benefits, including increased food production, increased resilience to water and nutrient scarcity and greater circularity in the economy.\nOptions for water sources used for drinking-water and irrigation will continue to evolve, with an increasing reliance on groundwater and alternative sources, including wastewater.

For example, fast-food advertising to youth activates highly sensitive and still-developing pathways in teens\u2019 brains.Mass removal of trees creates mosquito breeding sites, causing vector-borne disease outbreaks like malaria and chikungunya, with up to 20% of malaria risk in deforestation hotspots attributable to international trade of deforestation-implicated export commodities such as timber, tobacco, cocoa, coffee and cotton.Factories, which are disproportionately located in disadvantaged communities, pollute the air, causing and exacerbating respiratory diseases.Unsafe or toxic work environments can impact employee mental health, for example for women working in the ready-made garment industry.Commercial action in knowledge environments can foment groundless doubt and contribute to climate change denialism or vaccine hesitancy.Intensive animal agriculture is a leading cause of climate change, deforestation, antimicrobial resistance, and air, soil and water pollution. The consumption of animal-derived food products is linked to higher rates of noncommunicable diseases, including some cancers and diabetes.Workers in slaughterhouses and meat packaging facilities, which are often located in disadvantaged communities, suffered high rates of injury and experienced high rates of infection from COVID-19.Harmful use of intellectual property law can prevent some communities to access affordable medicines.\nHowever, there are positive contributions by to public health, for example when companies implement the following health interventions:\nincreasing the availability of essential medicines and health technologies, and supporting improved access to essential, high-quality, safe, effective and affordable medicines and medical products;reformulation of goods and products to reduce harm and injury, including the industry introduction of seat belts, efforts to reduce salt content in food production, and to eliminate trans fats from the global food supply;ensuring living wages, paid parental leave to improve child health outcomes, sick leave and access to health insurance; andfinancial decisions to divest from products and services harmful to health.\nThe workplace also functions as a setting of health promotion and protection against harm, allowing following:\nprinciples to guard against modern slavery, exploitation or indentured servitude;occupational health and safety standards and hygiene practices that reduce the risk of disease or work-related disability;health promotion activities aimed at the workforce, including use of stairs, healthy canteens, walkathons or sports events; andhealth literacy events, including awareness building about deadly ailments, blood donation or vaccination."

Companies commonly influence public health through lobbying and party donations. This incentivizes politicians and political parties to align decisions with commercial agendas. Further, some commercial actors work to capture branches of government in order to prevent or weaken regulation of their products and services, leading to unregulated activity, limiting their liability and bypassing the threat of litigation and pre-emption.\nTo further shape preferences, some companies capture civil society by founding or funding front groups, consumer groups and think tanks, allowing them to manufacture doubt and promote their framings."

The Resolution recommends a shift from the traditional curative approach towards a preventive approach that includes promotion of oral health within the family, schools and workplaces, and includes timely, comprehensive and inclusive care within the primary health-care system. The Resolution affirms that oral health should be firmly embedded within the NCD agenda and that oral health-care interventions should be included in national universal health coverage benefit packages.\nIn response to the mandate outlined in the resolution, the Secretariat developed theGlobal strategy on oral health, adopted in May 2022 (decision WHA75.11), and included theGlobal oral health action plan 2023\u20122030 (GOHAP)in the report on NCDs, noted by the Seventy-sixth World Health Assembly in 2023 (WHA76.9).\u00a0The GOHAP includes a range of actions for Member States, the WHO Secretariat, international partners, civil society organizations and the private sector.\nIn 2024, as an outcome of the first ever WHO Global Oral Health Meeting that took place 26\u201329 November in Bangkok, Thailand, theBangkok Declaration \u2013 No Health Without Oral Healthwas adopted. This Declaration advocates for elevating oral diseases as a global public health priority. The Bangkok Declaration reiterates Member States' commitment to the landmark 2021 resolution on oral health, which advances the prevention and control of oral diseases as part of the NCD, UHC and environmental agendas. It\u00a0emphasizes the need to strengthen health systems through primary health care approaches, ensuring that environmental sustainability and climate resilience are central components.\nReferences\n1.

It can also be passed from a mother to her baby.\nHepatitis B can be prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. The vaccine is usually given soon after birth with boosters a few weeks later. It offers nearly 100% protection against the virus.\nHepatitis B is a major global health problem. The burden of infection is highest in the WHO Western Pacific Region and the WHO African Region, where 97\u00a0million and 65\u00a0million people, respectively, are chronically infected. Sixty-one\u00a0million people are infected in the WHO South-East Asia Region, 15\u00a0million in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, 11\u00a0million in the WHO in the WHO European Region and 5\u00a0million in the WHO Region of the Americas."

The development of chronic infection is very common in infants infected from their mothers or before the age of 5 years.\nHepatitis B is also spread by needlestick injury, tattooing, piercing and exposure to infected blood and body fluids, such as saliva and menstrual, vaginal and seminal fluids. Transmission of the virus may also occur through the sharing or reuse of contaminated needles and syringes or sharp objects either in health care settings, in the community or among persons who inject drugs. Sexual transmission is more prevalent in unvaccinated persons with multiple sexual partners.\nHepatitis B infection acquired in adulthood leads to chronic hepatitis in less than 5% of cases, whereas infection in infancy and early childhood leads to chronic hepatitis in about 95% of cases. This is the basis for strengthening and prioritizing infant and childhood vaccination.\nThe hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. The incubation period of the hepatitis B virus ranges from 30 to 180 days. The virus may be detected within 30 to 60 days after infection and can persist and develop into chronic hepatitis B, especially when transmitted in infancy or childhood."

Physical examination, ultrasound and elastography can also be performed to assess degree of liver fibrosis and scarring and monitor progression of liver disease. WHO recommends that all blood donations be tested for hepatitis B to ensure blood safety and avoid accidental transmission.\nAs of 2022, 13% of all people estimated to be living with hepatitis B were aware of their infection, while 3% (7 million) of the people living with chronic hepatitis B were on treatment. According to latest WHO estimates, the proportion of children under five years of age chronically infected with HBV dropped to just under 1% in 2019 down from around 5% in the pre-vaccine era ranging from the 1980s to the early 2000s.\nIn settings with intermediate and high Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroprevalence in the general population (defined as>2% HBsAg seroprevalence), WHO recommends that all adults have access to and be offered HBsAg testing with linkage to prevention and care and treatment services as needed. WHO also recommends targeted testing, in all settings, of people with suspicions of liver disease, blood donors, and all pregnant women, the latter in order to provide the opportunity to institute measures for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). In addition, WHO recommends testing among specific high-risk groups, including migrants from endemic regions, partners or family members of infected persons, health-care workers, people who inject drugs (PWID), people in prisons and other closed settings, men who have sex with men (MSM) sex workers, transgender people and people living with HIV."

It is characterized by recurrent seizures, which are brief episodes of involuntary movement that may involve a part of the body (partial) or the entire body (generalized) and are sometimes accompanied by loss of consciousness and control of bowel or bladder function.\nSeizure episodes are a result of excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells. Different parts of the brain can be the site of such discharges. Seizures can vary from the briefest lapses of attention or muscle jerks to severe and prolonged convulsions. Seizures can also vary in frequency, from less than one per year to several per day.\nOne seizure does not signify epilepsy (up to 10% of people worldwide have one seizure during their lifetime). Epilepsy is defined as having two or more unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is one of the world\u2019s oldest recognized conditions, with written records dating back to 4000 BCE. Fear, misunderstanding, discrimination and social stigma have surrounded epilepsy for centuries. This stigma continues in many countries today and can impact on the quality of life for people with the disease and their families."

An economic study from India estimated that public financing for both first- and second-line therapy and other medical costs alleviates the financial burden from epilepsy and is cost-effective.\nThe stigma and discrimination that surround epilepsy worldwide are often more difficult to overcome than the seizures themselves.

They can be defined as structural or functional anomalies (for example, metabolic disorders) that occur during intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally, at birth, or sometimes may only be detected later in infancy, such as hearing defects. Broadly, congenital refers to the existence at or before birth.\nThe proportion of under-5 deaths due to congenital disorders increases as other causes of under-5 deaths are controlled (fig. 1).\nFig 1:Changes in causes of under 5 deaths as under 5 mortality rates decline\nCauses and risk factors\nGenetic\nA minority of congenital disorders are caused by genetic abnormalities i.e. chromosomal abnormalities (for example Down syndrome or trisomy 21) or\u00a0single gene defects (for example cystic fibrosis).\nConsanguinity (when parents are related by blood) also increases the prevalence of rare genetic congenital disorders and nearly doubles the risk for neonatal and childhood death, intellectual disability and other anomalies.\nLow-income may be an indirect determinant of congenital disorders, with a higher frequency among resource-constrained families and countries. It is estimated that about 94% of severe congenital disorders occur in low- and middle-income countries. An indirect determinant, this higher risk relates to a possible lack of access to sufficient nutritious foods by pregnant women, an increased exposure to agents or factors such as infection and alcohol, or poorer access to health care and screening.\nMaternal age is also a risk factor for abnormal intrauterine fetal development. Advanced maternal age increases the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome.\nEnvironmental factors including infections\nOthers occur because of environmental factors like maternal infections (syphilis, rubella, Zika), exposure to radiation, certain pollutants, maternal nutritional deficiencies (e.g., iodine, folate deficiency), illness (maternal diabetes) or certain drugs\r\n    (alcohol, phenytoin).\nUnknown causes\nWhile complex genetic and environmental interactions are proposed, most congenital disorders have unknown causes, including congenital heart defects, cleft lip or palate and club foot.\nPrevention\nPreventive public health measures work to decrease the frequency of certain congenital disorders through the removal of risk factors or the reinforcement of protective factors. Important interventions and efforts include:\nensuring adolescent girls and mothers have a healthy diet including a wide variety of vegetables and fruit, and maintain a healthy weight;ensuring an adequate dietary intake of vitamins and minerals, particularly folic acid in adolescent girls and mothers;ensuring mothers avoid harmful substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco;avoidance of travel by pregnant women (and sometimes women of child-bearing age) to regions experiencing outbreaks of infections known to be associated with congenital disorders;reducing or eliminating environmental exposure to hazardous substances (such as heavy metals or pesticides) during pregnancy;controlling diabetes prior to and during pregnancy through counselling, weight management, diet and administration of insulin when required;ensuring that any exposure of pregnant women to medications or medical radiation (such as imaging rays) is justified and based on careful health risk\u2013benefit analysis;vaccination, especially against the rubella virus, for children and women;increasing and strengthening education of health staff and others involved in promoting prevention of congenital disorders; andscreening for infections, especially rubella, varicella and syphilis, and consideration of treatment."

Screening can be conducted during the 3 periods listed:\nPreconception screening:\nThis can be useful to identify those at risk of specific disorders or of passing a disorder onto their children. Screening includes obtaining family histories and carrier screening and is particularly valuable in countries where consanguineous marriage\r\n    is common.\nPeri-conception screening:\nMaternal characteristics may increase risk, and screening results should be used to offer appropriate care, according to risk. This may include screening for young or advanced maternal age, as well as screening for use of alcohol, tobacco or other risks.\r\n    Ultrasound can be used to screen for Down syndrome and major structural abnormalities during the first trimester, and for severe fetal anomalies during the second trimester. Maternal blood can be screened for placental markers to aid in prediction\r\n    of risk of chromosomal abnormalities or neural tube defects, or for free fetal DNA to screen for many chromosomal abnormalities. Diagnostic tests such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis can be used to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities\r\n    and infections in women at high risk.\nNeonatal screening:\nScreening of newborns is an important step towards detection. This helps to reduce mortality and morbidity from congenital disorders by facilitating earlier referral and the initiation of medial or surgical treatment.\nEarly screening for hearing loss provides an opportunity for early correction and allows the possibility of acquiring better language, speech and communication skills. Early screening of newborns for congenital cataract also allows early referral and\r\n    surgical correction which increases the likelihood of sight.\nNewborns may be screened for certain metabolic, hematologic and endocrine disorders, many of which may not have immediately visible effects. The conditions screened for vary by country, depending on prevalence and cost. Newborn screening is increasingly\r\n    conducted even in low- and middle-income countries.\nTreatment and care\nSome congenital disorders can be treated with medical or surgical interventions. Access to this care may vary by country and by different levels of a health system, though complex care is increasingly available in low- and middle-income settings.\nSurgery with good follow up care can often mitigate the potential lethality (as in the case of congenital heart defects) or the morbidity (e.g., congenital talipes, cleft lip/palate) associated with structural congenital disorders. The contribution to reducing\r\n    mortality and morbidity of this aspect of the treatment is often underestimated. Outcomes are improved with early detection at lower levels of the system through screening, referral and management (at specialist centres in case of some issues like\r\n    cardiac defects).\nMedical treatment for certain metabolic, endocrine and hematological conditions can improve quality of life. A clear example is congenital hypothyroidism, where early detection and treatment allows full physical and mental development to healthy adulthood,\r\n    whereas a missed diagnosis or unavailability of a simple treatment carries a risk of serious intellectual disability.\nChildren with some types of congenital disorders may require long term support including physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy and support from families and community."

RSV causes a wide spectrum of respiratory disease, from mild upper respiratory tract infections (in most cases) to life threatening lower respiratory tract infections (2). Infants, especially those under six months of age, are at highest risk of severe RSV disease and death. RSV can also cause severe disease among elderly people and those with underlying illnesses. Until recently, there was no vaccine available to protect infants and elderly people from RSV disease. In the last few years, several vaccines and a long-acting monoclonal antibody have been licensed and are starting to be used to prevent severe RSV disease in these high-risk populations."

The hospitalization rate for adults infected with RSV is higher among individuals with underlying conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or congestive heart failure(4).\nMost countries demonstrate RSV seasonality, with most annual RSV infections occurring over a several month period(5). In temperate climates, RSV causes seasonal epidemics, tending to occur in late fall and winter, with an average duration of elevated viral circulation of five months. Although not as sharply defined, most sub-tropical and tropical countries also experience consistent months of high RSV circulation during each year but with no clear seasonality patterns(5, 6)."

Maternal immunization allows transfer of antibodies against RSV through the placenta to the unborn baby, who is then protected for approximately 6 months after birth.\nAnother immunization product to protect babies is a long-acting monoclonal antibody that targets the RSV virus. It is given as an intramuscular injection to protect against severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection lung disease during RSV infection. This product can be administrated to all neonates and infants entering their first RSV season.

        "content": "Asbestos is a group of naturally occurring mineral fibres. It has widespread current or historical commercial uses because of its material properties (strong, heat resistant). There are six main forms of asbestos, and the main form in current use is chrysotile (white asbestos).\nAll six main forms of asbestos have beenassessed by WHOas being carcinogenic to humans. Exposure to asbestos, including chrysotile, causes cancer of the lung, larynx and ovaries, and mesothelioma (a cancer of the pleural and peritoneal linings). There is also clear scientific evidence that asbestos causes chronic respiratory diseases such as asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs), and other adverse effects on the lungs.\nDue to the widespread uses of asbestos, and therefore high numbers of people potentially exposed to this material, asbestos has been estimated to cause deaths and ill health in large numbers of people every year."

This represents over 70% of deaths from work-related cancers. In addition to this estimate of mortality, exposure to asbestos is also estimated to cause a substantial burden of ill health (loss of nearly 4 million disability-adjusted life years \u2013 a standardized measure of ill-health). A substantial level of deaths and ill health are also attributed to exposure to asbestos outside the workplace. It has also been shown that co-exposure to tobacco smoke and asbestos fibres substantially increases the risk for lung cancer \u2013 and the heavier the smoking, the greater the risk."

There is also exposure during the mining and processing of asbestos, and in the production and use of asbestos-containing products including brake shoes, brake pads and clutches for vehicles, and in particular building materials such as roof tiles made with asbestos cement. Anyone trimming or fitting asbestos-containing products is potentially at risk.\nExposure to asbestos fibres also occurs where asbestos-containing products have become degraded, such as during building maintenance and demolition and the disposal of building waste. Damage to buildings because of natural disasters is a particular concern if asbestos-containing building materials have been used. Anyone engaging in construction, maintenance and demolition of buildings where asbestos has been used is potentially at risk, even many years or decades after the asbestos was put in place."
