For people who are sensitive to molds exposure to molds can lead to symptoms such as stuffy nose, wheezing, and red or itchy eyes, or skin. Severe reactions, such as fever or shortness of breath, may occur among workers exposed to large amounts of molds in occupational settings, such as farmers working around moldy hay.\nIn 2004 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found there was sufficient evidence to link indoor exposure to mold with upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, and wheeze in otherwise healthy people; with asthma symptoms in people with asthma; and with hypersensitivity pneumonitis in individuals susceptible to that immune-mediated condition.\nIn 2009, the World Health Organization issued additional guidance, the WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Dampness and Mould.  Other recent studies have suggested a potential link of early mold exposure to development of asthma in some children, particularly among children who may be genetically susceptible to asthma development, and that selected interventions that improve housing conditions can reduce morbidity from asthma and respiratory allergies."

The solution and water vessels both had to be products that families would be willing to use, and education to improve hygiene and water handling practices was critical.\nPromising pilot studies in Bolivia led to partnerships with Proctor & Gamble and Population Services International, a non-governmental organization. In 1996, the first national Safe Water System program-called CLARO was launched in Bolivia. CDC Safe Water System programs are now running in 24 countries around the world \u2014 from Afghanistan to Zambia.

Long-term programs require many partners (both governmental and non-governmental), community will, and long-term strategies for how to manufacture and distribute SWS\u00a0products. Some of the most successful programs in countries such as Bolivia and Kenya contribute significantly to local economies by providing jobs to health educators, distributors, and manufacturers.\nTo encourage communities to treat household drinking water through the Safe Water System, health educators draw upon various behavior change techniques, including social marketing, community mobilization, health education, and promotion. Organized community-by-community, education campaigns show the link between contaminated water and disease, as well as the benefits of safe water and hygienic behaviors. Because fecal contamination from poor sanitation practices and unwashed hands and foods can spread disease, these campaigns also promote hand-washing and proper latrine use.\nThe Safe Water System (SWS)\u00a0works best in communities where families have enough water for their daily needs. Each community faces different challenges. It is critical to understand the sources of water; how it is collected, transported, and stored; as well as local sanitation, cultural, and economic practices. Successful programs start with community will and buy-in, often coupled with technical and financial assistance from governments, non-governmental agencies, and industries.\nFor a Safe Water System (SWS) to have a health impact, households must obtain and correctly use the disinfectant on an ongoing basis. Although there is significant debate about pricing of health products for people in developing countries, it is generally accepted that users who pay something for a product\u2014even a minimal amount\u2014are more likely to value the product, use it correctly, and continue to use it.\nSocial marketing uses commercial marketing methods, such as branding and consumer research, to increase the acceptability of a product to meet a social need. Products are subsidized to some degree depending upon the capacity of a community or country and the amount of donor support available. Many SWS projects have used social marketing strategies, including advertising, community events such as parades and skits, and T-shirt giveaways."

Items should be machine washed using hot water (temperatures in excess of 50\u00b0C or 122\u00b0F for 10 minutes will kill mites and eggs), dried on the hot cycle, or dry-cleaned. Seal items you can't wash or dry-clean in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than two to three days away from human skin. Children and adults can usually return to childcare, school, or work the day after treatment."

Scabicides require a doctor's prescription. No non-prescription products have been tested and approved to treat scabies. Carefully follow the instructions contained in the box or on the label. Scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. For infants and children, the lotion or cream should be applied to their entire head and neck as well as the rest of the body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off.\nThe itching of scabies is due to a hypersensitivity reaction (allergy) to mites and their feces, so itching may continue for several weeks after treatment even if all the mites and eggs are killed. However, if itching still is present two to four weeks after treatment or if new burrows or pimple-like rash appear, retreatment may be necessary."

The exposure potential includes the following considerations:\nAt the end of the control banding process, users have a proposed control measure to implement (see example matrix).\nControl measures serve to decrease risk. Examples of recommended control measures could be personal protective equipment, dilution ventilation, engineering controls, containment, or some other hazard control. This approach is based on two pillars:\nControl banding uses the solutions that experts have developed previously to control occupational chemical exposures and suggests applying them to other tasks with similar exposure situations. It is an approach that focuses resources on exposure controls and describes how a risk needs to be managed. NIOSH considers control banding to be a potentially useful tool for small businesses.\nControl banding is best used with thehierarchy of controls, which aims to protect workers by reducing exposure to hazards in the workplace. For example, a hazardous chemical can be substituted with a less hazardous chemical.\nIt is important to note that control banding is NOT a replacement for experts in occupational safety and health. Sometimes the control banding advice directly guides employers to seek expert guidance.\nSpecific operating knowledge and professional judgment are required to implement the best combination of controls that are \u201creasonably practicable\u201d and to minimize risks to workers. Control banding also does not eliminate the need to perform exposure monitoring.\nControl banding and occupational exposure banding are both techniques for managing risk for chemicals that do not have an OEL. Occupational exposure banding uses the \u201cbanding\u201d concept differently, applying hazard-based data (such as studies on human health effects or toxicology studies) to calculate which of five \u201cbands\u201d is appropriate. Each occupational exposure band (OEB) has an exposure limit range. After completing the OEB process, users must determine whether workplace exposures fall within that range. They must also decide what controls to put in place if the results exceed the range. Once controls are in place, it is important to perform exposure monitoring or assessment to verify the exposures no longer exceed the range of concern.\nIn contrast, control banding ends with specific exposure control and risk management strategies. Control banding can be used together with the OEB methodology. It\u2019s important to note that any control banding or OEB needs follow up. These methods are not a replacement for health surveillance or environmental samples. In addition, this is not a process that should be performed only once. Routine follow-up should always be performed in addition to changes in tasks/process/materials."

Sexual violence survivors are more likely to smoke, abuse alcohol, use drugs, and engage in risky sexual activity.8\nThe trauma from sexual violence may impact a survivor's employment. This refers to time off from work, diminished performance, job loss, or inability to work. These issues disrupt earning power and have a long-term effect on the economic well-being of survivors and their families. Coping and completing everyday tasks after victimization can be challenging. Survivors may have difficulty maintaining personal relationships, returning to work or school, and regaining a sense of normalcy.7\nSexual violence is also connected to other forms of violence. For example, girls who have been sexually abused are more likely to experience additional sexual violence. They are also more likely to become victims of intimate partner violence in adulthood.Bullying perpetration in early middle school is linked to sexual harassment perpetration in high school.9"

They can make sure the dog you choose fits your lifestyle and needs.\nWash your handswith soap and running water:\nYou can use an alcohol-basedhand sanitizerthat contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available.\nAdults should always supervise hand washing for children under 5 years of age.\n Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations.\nCleaning up after your dog and keeping the environment clean reduces the risk of diseases spreading to people and other animals.\nAlways pick up dog poop and dispose of it properly.\nDog poop should be picked up, even in your own yard, and especially in areas where children may play.\nDog bites can cause pain, injury, and spread germs that cause infection. Nearly 1 in 5 people bitten by a dog requires medical attention.\nAny dog can bite especially when scared, nervous, eating, or when playing or protecting toys or puppies. Dogs may also bite when they aren't feeling well and want to be left alone.\nThere are many things you can do at home and within your community to help prevent dog scratches and bites. Practicing the safe handling tips below can help you avoid dog bites.\nChildren are more likely than adults to be bitten by a dog. The injuries from dog bites in children also tend to be more severe. Most dog bites affecting young children occur during everyday activities and while interacting with familiar dogs.\nHaving a dog in the household is linked to a higher likelihood of being bitten than not having a dog. As the number of dogs in the home increases, so does the likelihood of being bitten.\nAdults with two or more dogs in the household are five times more likely to be bitten. This is comparison to people living without dogs at home. Among adults, men are more likely than women to be bitten by a dog.\nDo not disturb a dog while it is eating, sleeping, or caring for puppies. Do not pet a dog if it appears to be hiding or seeing time alone. Do not continue petting a dog if it seems scared, sick, or angry.\nIf a dog knocks you over, curl into a ball. Tuck your head and place your hands over your ears and neck. You can also put a purse, bag, or jacket between you and the dog. Avoid doing the following actions to keep yourself safe:\nPetting another owner's dog\nPreventing dog bites in children\nDo not let young children play with dogs without supervision, even if the child has met the dog previously. This includes your family pet dog.\nResponsible pet ownership, including socializing your dog and using a leash in public, can help prevent dog bites.\nPreventing bites from unfamiliar dogs\nDo not approach an unfamiliar dog, even if it seems friendly or healthy. Call animal control if you see a dog in trouble or a dog running loose.\nIf an unfamiliar dog approaches you, stay still, be calm, and avoid direct eye contact with the dog. Say \"no\" or \"go home\" in a firm, deep voice and stand with the side of your body facing the dog. Slowly raise your hands to your neck with your elbows in. Wait for the dog to pass or slowly back away.\nGerms can be spread from dog bites and scratches, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious.\nFor minor wounds\nFor deep wounds\nApply pressure with a clean, dry cloth to stop the bleeding for deep wounds. Seek medical attention right away.\nCall 911 or your local emergency medical services immediately if you cannot stop the bleeding or you feel faint or weak.\nSee if a healthcare provider if:\nSerious wounds are characterized by uncontrolled bleeding, extreme pain, and loss of function.\nInfected wounds may be red, painful, or swollen, or cause a fever.\nLet the healthcare provider know that you were bitten by a dog. The healthcare provider may consult with your state or local health department to help you decide if you need rabies treatment. This is known as rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP).\nAnyone who is bitten by a dog is at risk of getting rabies. Consider contacting your local animal control agency or police department to report the incident. This is especially important if you don't know if the dog has been vaccinated against rabies. It is also important to report the bite if the dog appears sick or is acting strangely.\nIf possible, contact the owner and ensure the animal has a current rabies vaccination.

Consider your home, and the amount of time you have to spend with your pet.\nPick a dog that is bright, alert, and playful. Dogs and puppies should have shiny, soft fur that is free of poop.\nSigns of illness in a dog include appearing sluggish or depressed, having diarrhea. Abnormal breathing, and fluid running from its eyes or nose is also common in dogs with illnesses.\nMake sure to take your new dog or puppy to the veterinarian within a few days to a week after adoption.\nTake your dog to the veterinarian promptly If your dog becomes sick or dies soon after purchase or adoption. Make sure to tell your veterinarian if the pet was adopted internationally.\nInform the pet store, breeder, or rescue organization about the pet's illness or death.\nThoroughly clean the area your pet lived in.\nIt is important to provide a safe, warm, and comfortable environment for your dog.\nIf your dog will be housed outside, provide shelter such as a doghouse. This will protect your dog when it is cold or rainy and shade for when it is hot. Protecting your dog from the changes in weather will reduce stress and help keep it healthy.\nMake sure your dog has access to fresh, clean water and food every day.\nConsider fencing in your yard. A fence gives your dog room to play. It will also protect it from wild animals and reduce the risk of strangers interacting with your dog.\nIt is not recommended to keep dogs tied up outside.

Some research suggest that a genital herpes infection may lead to miscarriage or make it more likely to deliver your baby too early. You can pass herpes to your unborn child before birth, but it more commonly passes during delivery. This can lead to a deadly infection in your baby (called neonatal herpes). It is important that you avoid getting genital herpes during pregnancy. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had a genital herpes diagnosis or symptoms. Also tell them about any possible exposure to genital herpes.\nIf you have genital herpes, you may need to take anti-herpes medicine towards the end of your pregnancy.

Over 45 million people were vaccinated and there were increased reports of GBS following vaccination. Those who received the 1976 swine flu vaccine had a slight increased risk for developing GBS of approximately one additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. Scientists have several theories about the cause, but the exact reason for this link remains unknown.\nCDC monitors GBS cases during each flu season. From data collected, the association between seasonal flu vaccine and GBS has been found to vary from season to season. When there has been an increased risk, it has consistently been in the range of 1-2 additional GBS cases per million flu vaccine doses administered.\nAdditional studies have been conducted on the risk of GBS following flu vaccination. Results of these studies suggest that it is more likely that a person will get GBS after getting the flu than after vaccination. It is important to keep in mind flu infection can potentially cause severe illness and death. The best way to prevent flu infection and its complications is to get the flu vaccine.\nCDC monitors multiple vaccine safety systems to determine if GBS is occurring more among those who are vaccinated than the general rate of GBS in the population.\nRecent CDC studies based on data from theVaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)and theVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)have found evidence suggesting an increased risk of GBS among adults 18 years and older after J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccination but not after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination.

In regard to small businesses\nThe definition of a \u201csmall\u201d business varies widely, particularly as it relates to workplace safety and health. The characteristics that distinguish a smaller business from a larger one in terms of occupational safety and health include:\nDespite the stereotype of a small business as a small town retail or service firm, some smaller businesses do not fit the stereotype, e.g., high-tech manufacturing startups.\nFor most occupational safety and health research purposes, the NIOSH Small Business Assistance Program considers small businesses as having fewer than 50 employees. This number is consistent with European Union criteria for defining small enterprises, as well as the Affordable Care Act cutoff for requiring employers to provide health insurance to employees."

Market forces, structural changes, and emerging social and business climate threats may affect levels of resources available for occupational safety and health initiatives for small businesses.\nWhile two-thirds of new small businesses survive at least 2 years, only 44% survive at least 4 years. These numbers are consistent across sectors. One research team found that businesses that lasted five years had less than half the annual workplace injury rate as businesses that lasted only two years.\nSmall business owners frequently cite financial limitations as a barrier to implementing recommended health and safety programs. Other issues frequently take precedence when small businesses survive on the edge of viability. For example, according to a National Federation of Independent Business membership survey, the number one small business issue is the cost and availability of insurance."

EIP sites also investigate causes of infectious disease outbreaks, evaluate effectiveness of interventions, and promote prevention.\nThe EIP network can be leveraged in emergencies to rapidly scale up surveillance of emerging infectious diseases and inform quick decision making. During the COVID-19 pandemic, EIP sitesworked togetherto collect extensive data on hospitalized patients, includingthose first affected. This work described disease trends among adults andchildren,highlighted differences in hospitalization rates of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and informed recommendations on strategies to prevent infection.\nEIP sites rely on robust and integrated data reporting and sharing systems.

The OLSR safety inspectors visit CDC laboratories annually to ensure that their practices, procedures, and equipment meet key safety standards. The oversight includes ensuring that CDC laboratories are in full compliance with the requirements of theFederal Select Agent Program, which regulates the possession, use, and transfer of biological select agents and toxins.\nThe OLSR also manages CDC\u2019s Animal Care and Use Program Office (ACUPO), assuring CDC compliance with guidance and regulations for the responsible care of research animals at CDC.\nCDC co-authors the foundational biosafety manualBiosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL),in partnership with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Now in its 6th Edition, the BMBL has become the standard guidance for biosafety practices in laboratories across the country.\nLearn more about the BMBL\nCDC has a legal and moral responsibility to ensure that the animals entrusted to our care are treated in accordance with the highest standards of animal welfare and care. Research studies involving animals conducted at or supported by CDC must comply with the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) under Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 1-3 as well as thePublic Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals(PHS Policy) administered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW). As an OLAW Assured institution, all CDC animal studies adhere to theGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. In addition, all animal studies must be approved by and conducted in accordance with the policies set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), an oversight body mandated by the AWA to review all research studies involving animals at CDC to ensure compliance with animal welfare standards.

To spur the science of safety in CDC laboratories, OLSR supports CDC laboratories to advance innovative research or solutions to laboratory safety challenges.\nOne of the tenets ofCDC's Pledge to the American Peopleis that CDC will \"base all public health decisions on the highest quality scientific data that is derived openly and objectively.\" OLSR is committed to ensuring that CDC laboratories continue to fulfill this pledge and serve as a model for scientific excellence and quality.\nThe scientific data produced by CDC's laboratories provides a crucial foundation for sound, evidence-based public health decision-making across the country. OLSR aids this work by providing CDC laboratories with leadership and technical expertise that both supports, and helps to advance excellence in laboratory science throughout CDC.\nOLSR supports this work by providing oversight and coordination of laboratory quality management and training programs for CDC laboratories. OLSR establishes teams responsible for developing agency-level plans, policies, guidelines, manuals, and tools for implementation of quality management programs within Centers, Institutes and Offices, and for the continual improvement of laboratory quality and safety training for CDC staff.\nCDC's Laboratory Leadership Service (LLS) is a fellowship program that prepares early career laboratory scientists to become future laboratory leaders. The fellowship combines competency-based public health laboratory training with practical, applied investigations and service. LLS will provide CDC and public health laboratories across the country with a pool of expertly trained laboratory scientists poised to meet the evolving challenges of laboratory science and safety.\nLearn more about CDC's Laboratory Leadership Service\nMaximizing the safety and impact of CDC's laboratories requires a workforce of laboratory scientists trained in state-of-the-art techniques and technology. In partnership with theDivision of Laboratory SystemsandSafe Labs Program, OLSR supports the development of a comprehensive training curriculum to ensure that CDC's laboratory scientists are equipped to meet current and future public health challenges.\nIn 2019, CDC opened astate-of-the-art laboratory training facilitywhere these trainings could be held. The 4,760 square-foot facility was designed to provide hands-on training to laboratory scientists with access to high containment laboratories. This space offers CDC laboratory programs a facility to test new protocols and equipment in a realistic laboratory setting in the absence of pathogens.\nLearn more about CDC Laboratory Trainings"

VAMS allows for gathering and analysis of real-time or near-real-time vaccination data in vaccination clinics.\nParticipation in VAMSis currently limited to jurisdictions, federal agencies, and organizations, that have enrolled in VAMS and to the individuals who live, work, or volunteer in those organizations and jurisdictions.

When humans consume raw or undercooked infected fish, larvae move to the intestine and mature to adult worms. Female worms deposit eggs in the intestine, which are then released through feces. When infected human feces reach freshwater, fish can get infected and the cycle continues. In some cases eggs may hatch within the human intestine, causing hyperinfection (a massive number of adult worms).\nC. philippinensisis not transmitted from infected humans to other humans; transmission requires the intermediate freshwater fish host.

        "heading": "How it works",
        "content": "Water utilities often use a series of water treatment steps that include coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection.\nCoagulationis often the first step in water treatment. Treatment plant staff add chemicals to the water that help bind together dirt and other small particles. The chemicals they commonly use include specific types of salts, aluminum, or iron.\nFlocculationis next. Flocculation is the gentle mixing of the water to form larger, heavier particles called flocs. Often, treatment plant staff will add additional chemicals during this step to help the flocs form.\nSedimentationseparates out solids from the water. Flocs are heavier than water, so they settle to the bottom of the water during this step.\nFiltrationis the next step. Once the flocs have settled to the bottom of the water, the clear water on top goes through several filters.\nThe filters have different pore (hole) sizes and are made of materials such as sand, gravel, or charcoal. These filters remove germs, including parasites, bacteria, and viruses. They also remove dissolved particles, such as dust and chemicals. Activated carbon filters remove bad smells.\nUtilities that use a process called ultrafiltration put water through a filter with very small pores. This filter only lets through water and other small molecules (such as salts and tiny, charged molecules).\nReverse osmosisis another way to filter water that removes additional particles from water. Water treatment plants often use reverse osmosis when treatingrecycled wateror salt water for drinking.\nDisinfectionis often the last step. Water treatment plants may add one or more chemical disinfectants to kill any remaining germs. Common types of chemical disinfectants includechlorine, chloramine, or chlorine dioxide.\nTreatment plant staff make sure the water has low levels of the chemical disinfectant when it leaves the treatment plant. This remaining disinfectant killsgerms living in the pipesbetween the water treatment plant and your tap.\nWater treatment plants can also use ultraviolet (UV) light or ozone to disinfect water. They may use UV light or ozone instead of, or in addition to, chemical disinfectants. UV light and ozone work well to disinfect water in the treatment plant. However, these methods do not continue killing germs as water travels through the pipes between the treatment plant and your tap."

Botulism causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death.\nThe toxin is made byClostridium botulinumand sometimesClostridium butyricumandClostridium baratiibacteria (germs). These bacteria can produce the toxin in food, wounds, and the intestines of infants.\nThe bacteria that make botulinum toxin are found naturally in many places, but it's rare for them to make people sick. These bacteria make spores, which act like protective coatings. Spores help the bacteria survive in the environment, even in extreme conditions.\nThe spores usually do not cause people to become sick, even when they're eaten. But under certain conditions, these spores can grow and make one of the most lethal toxins known.\nThe conditions in which the spores can grow and make toxin are:\nFor example, improperlyhome-canned, preserved, or fermented foodscan provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin. When people eat these foods, they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don't get proper medical treatment quickly."

Common sources of foodborne botulism arehomemade foodsthat have been improperly canned, preserved, or fermented. Though uncommon, store-bought foods also can be contaminated with botulinum toxin.\nWound botulism can happen if the spores get into a wound and make a toxin.People who inject illicit drugshave a greater chance of getting wound botulism. People who have had a traumatic injury, such as a motorcycle crash, or surgery also can get wound botulism.\nFor reasons we do not understand, some infants get botulism when the spores get into their intestines, grow, and produce the toxin.\nIatrogenic botulism can happen if too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons, such as for wrinkles. It also can happen if too much of the toxin is injected for medical reasons, such as for migraine headaches.\nAdult intestinal toxemia is also known as adult intestinal colonization. This kind of botulism is a very rare. It can happen if the spores of the bacteria get into an adult's intestines, grow, and produce the toxin (similar to infant botulism). We don't know why people get this kind of botulism. People with a serious health condition affecting the gut might be more likely to get ill."

Asbestos is no longer mined in the United States, but it is imported from other countries to make some products. It is still present in some older homes and buildings.\nWorking with materials that contain asbestos can release tiny asbestos fibers, too small to see, into the air. Some workers and others who breathed in or swallowed asbestos fibers over many years have developed mesothelioma and other diseases. Not everyone who is exposed to asbestos will get mesothelioma or other cancers. If you are concerned, ask your doctor if you should get regular checkups or tests for asbestos-related diseases."

But once they do, the disease rapidly progresses and leads to death.\nSome of the reasons people may get sick with prion diseases is eating or handling meat contaminated with prions. People may also become infected if they get prions in their bodies. This may occur through organ transplant or being exposed to contaminated equipment during surgery."

        "content": "Many different prion diseases affect people, but some are more common than others. The most common prion disease in people is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Another prion disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), has a similar name but is a different, much rarer, disease.\nOther prion diseases include kuru, variably protease-sensitive prionopathy, sporadic fatal insomnia, and inherited forms caused by genetic mutations.\nCJD is a prion disease that causes a person's brain to break down or stop working normally. Once symptoms start, the disease progresses quickly. It is always fatal, usually within a year.\nCJD is sometimes called \"classic CJD\" to avoid confusion with variant CJD. Most cases of classic CJD are in older people. They appear sporadically. This means there is no known reason that the cases begin.\nA smaller number of cases occur in people who inherited genetic changes that make them prone to CJD. Occasionally, there have also been illnesses in people who were exposed to surgical equipment or other products contaminated with prions.\nvCJD is tied to eating beef from a cow that had a prion disease called Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). It was discovered in 1996 in the United Kingdom.\nThe disease affected much younger people than CJD. vCJD often infected people their 20s or younger. It caused mental symptoms and behaviors, as well as pain when touching things (dyesthesiasis), that CJD does not.\nThere have only been four vCJD cases reported in the United States.

        "content": "There are a number of known prion diseases in animals. The two most important in the United States are bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD).\nBSE is a type of prion disease that affects cows. The first cases were identified in the mid-1980s, but BSE didn't gain widespread attention until a major outbreak in the United Kingdom later that decade into the 1990s. Millions of cows were infected.\nBy 2005, 24 countries had reported BSE among native cattle. (20 of the 24 were in Europe).\nThe first BSE case in North America was reported in 1993 in a cow imported into Canada from the United Kingdom. Additional BSE cases were identified in Canada beginning in 2003.\nLater that year, a cow in Washington State also tested positive. The cow had come from a Canadian farm prior to being imported into the United States and was likely exposed there. This case remains the only classic BSE case identified in the United States, although cases of atypical BSE have been found.\nExperts eventually concluded that the spread of infection in cattle was likely tied to feeding practices. They speculate it began when cows were fed meat and bone meal from other cows that had prion disease.\nCWD is a prion disease that affects animals like deer, elk, moose, and reindeer. It has been found in the United States, Canada, Norway, Finland, and Sweden. Imported cases have also been reported in South Korea. First recognized in Colorado in the late 1960s, CWD has now been identified in 32 U.S. states.\nThough there have been no cases of CWD in people, experts think it poses a theoretical risk to people. This is because CWD is related to BSE, which has caused disease in people. If CWD could spread to people, hunters and people who eat meat from CWD-infected animals would likely be most at risk."

If semen is found to be slightly abnormal, it does not necessarily mean that a man is infertile.\nSome conditions that can disrupt testicular or ejaculatory function include the following:\nImproper function of the hypothalamus or pituitary glands are hormonal disorders that can cause infertility. These glands produce hormones that maintain normal testicular function. Too much of these hormones, especially prolactin, can result in infertility.

        "heading": "How do health care providers treat infertility?",
        "content": "There are a variety of treatment options for infertility. The type of treatment offered depends on the cause of infertility, its duration, and your age. Your health care provider may need to perform preliminary testing to determine the best treatment option for you. A couple's treatment preferences after they have received counseling about success rates, risk factors, and benefits of each option also determine how their infertility is treated.\nTreatment options for infertility may include timed intercourse, medications, intrauterine insemination, surgery, or assisted reproductive technology.\nTimed intercourse\u2014with or without\u2014medication is often the first option for many couples who are trying to conceive. It may be recommended for couples where the male has normal or close to normal sperm count and motility (movement), the female has open (or functioning) fallopian tubes, and the couple is physically able to have intercourse.\nWith timed intercourse, a couple tracks the woman's ovulation and has intercourse around the time of ovulation. If a woman ovulates normally on her own, she may not need to take medication. Otherwise, she may need to take medication (orally or through injection) to stimulate ovulation.\nThere are a variety of medications used to treat infertility in women. Many fertility medications increase a woman's chance of having twins, triplets, or other multiples. Women who are pregnant with multiples may have more problems during pregnancy and are at higher risk of being born prematurely (too early). Premature babies are at a higher risk of health and developmental problems. Your health care provider may talk with you about strategies to reduce the risk of multiple births while using infertility medications.\nIntrauterine insemination (IUI) is an infertility treatment that is sometimes referred to as \"artificial insemination.\" During this procedure, specially prepared sperm are inserted into the woman's uterus. This treatment may be recommended for couples in which the male has close to normal sperm count and motility (movement) and the ability to produce a semen sample in the office (or, under some circumstances, at home) and the woman has open, functioning fallopian tubes.\nThis treatment may be appropriate for couples:\nSurgical treatments for fertility are rare because of the success of other treatments, such as Intrauterine insemination (IUI) and In vitro fertilization (IVF). Surgery may be recommended to women with certain diagnoses to increase the likelihood of conceiving. Examples include removing fibroids surgically from the uterus with a procedure called a myomectomy or surgery to treat blocked fallopian tubes. Men may also be offered surgery for specific diagnoses, such as varicoceles.\nAssisted reproductive technology (ART)includes all fertility treatments in which either eggs or embryos are handled outside of the body. The main type of ART is in vitro fertilization (IVF). In general, ART procedures involve removing eggs from a woman's ovaries using a needle. These eggs are then combined with sperm in the laboratory to create embryos. The embryos are returned to the woman's body, frozen for future use, or donated to another woman.\nA variation of ART, called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), is often used for couples with male factor infertility. With ICSI, a single sperm is injected into a mature egg.\nPreimplantation genetic testing can be used during ART to identify genetic disorders or chromosomal abnormalities in embryos. One or more cells are biopsied from each embryo and sent for testing.\nART can be expensive and time-consuming. Despite these challenges, ART has helped many couples have children that otherwise would not have been conceived.\nSuccess rates after IVF vary and depend on many factors. They can include the clinic performing the procedure, the infertility diagnosis, and the age of the woman undergoing the procedure. The woman's age is especially important.\nCDC publishesART success ratesfor all fertility clinics in the United States. In addition, CDC created anIVF Success Estimatorto help estimate the chance of having a live birth using IVF based on the experiences of women and couples with similar characteristics.\nThe most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. This can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are transferred back to the uterus. For example, transfer of a single embryo greatly reduces the chances of a multiple pregnancy. Using a single embryo, rather than multiple embryos, lowers risks such aspreterm birth."

Donor eggs or donor sperm are sometimes used for other reasons, such as a genetic disease that can be passed on to the baby.\nAn infertile couple may also use donated embryos that were created by other couples in infertility treatment and were not used. When donated embryos are used, the child will not be genetically related to either parent. Donor eggs, donor sperm, or donated embryos may also be used by same-sex couples.\nA gestational carrier (surrogate) carries an embryo that was formed from the egg of another woman with the expectation of returning the infant to its intended parents. Women who have no uterus may be able to use a gestational carrier. Women who cannot become pregnant, or who have a serious health problem and should not become pregnant may also consider this option."

CO can build up indoors and poison people and animals who breathe it. However, you can reduce your risk of CO poisoning with a few small steps.\nInstall battery-operated or battery back-up CO detectors near every sleeping area in your home.\nCheck CO detector batteries when you change the time on your clocks each spring and fall to be sure they are functioning properly.\nConsider buying a detector with a digital readout. This type of detector can tell you the highest level of CO concentration in your home, in addition to sounding an alarm.\nReplace your CO detector following the manufacturer's instructions or every 5 years.  Set a reminder on your smartphone or other device calendar when you purchase and install the detector.\nHave your heating system, water heater, and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances serviced by a qualified technician every year.\nMake sure your gas appliances are vented properly. Horizontal vent pipes for appliances, such as a water heater, should go up slightly as they go toward outdoors, as shown below. This prevents CO from leaking if the joints or pipes aren't fitted tightly.\nWhen you buy gas equipment, buy only equipment carrying the seal of a national testing agency, such as Underwriters' Laboratories.\nIf you smell an odor from your gas refrigerator, have an expert service it. An odor from your gas refrigerator can mean it could be leaking CO.\nNever heat your house with a gas oven.\nDon't cook or burn anything on a stove or fireplace that isn't vented.\nHave your chimney checked or cleaned every year. Chimneys can be blocked by debris, which can cause CO to build up inside your home or cabin.\nNever burn charcoal indoors. Burning charcoal - red, gray, black, or white - gives off CO.\nNever use a portable gas camp stove indoors.\nDo not use portable flameless chemical heaters indoors.\nNever use a generator inside your home or garage, even if doors and windows are open.\nOnly use generators outside, more than 20 feet away from any windows, doors, and vents.\nWhen using a generator, use a battery-powered or battery backup CO detector in your home.\nHave a mechanic check the exhaust system of your car or truck every year. A small leak in the exhaust system can lead to a buildup of CO inside the car.\nNever run your car or truck inside a garage that is attached to a house, even with the garage door open. Always open the door to a detached garage to let in fresh air when you run a car or truck inside.\nIf you drive a car or SUV with a tailgate, when you open the tailgate open the vents or windows to make sure air is moving through. If only the tailgate is open, CO from the exhaust will be pulled into the car or SUV."

Some spread can occur in households through close contact (like sharing a bed or caring for someone who is sick). The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015. Multiple healthcare facilities were affected by the outbreak, which was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula.

SDOH have been shown to have a greater influence on health than either genetic factors or access to healthcare services. For example, poverty is highly correlated with poorer health outcomes and higher risk of premature death.ASDOH, including the effects of centuries of racism, are key drivers of health inequities within communities of color. The impact is pervasive and deeply embedded in our society, creating inequities in access to a range of social and economic benefits\u2014such as housing, education, wealth, and employment. These inequities put people at higher risk of poor health.\nCDC is coordinating efforts to focus its resources on the areas where federal public health investments can make the most difference. For example, CDC'sRacial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH)focuses on reducing high rates of chronic diseases for specific racial and ethnic groups in urban, rural, and tribal communities. Since 1999, the program has worked across sectors in racial and ethnic minority communities to reduce tobacco use, improve access to healthy foods, change the built environment to promote physical activity, and connect people to clinical care."

        "content": "Public health surveillance is the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of deaths, injuries, and illnesses to provide information about any adverse health effects related to a disaster event in a community. It allows us to assess the human health impacts of a disaster and evaluate potential problems related to planning and prevention.\nPublic health morbidity surveillance allows us to detect disease outbreaks and track disease and injury trends. A common myth is that epidemics are inevitable during a disaster. Early detection and response, however, can lessen the likelihood for outbreaks. Additionally, conducting health surveillance allows public health leaders and decision makers to make informed decisions about action items such as allocating resources, tailoring interventions to meet specific needs, and planning for future disasters.\nIn addition to public health morbidity surveillance, mortality surveillance can provide information that can prevent excess death. The number of deaths is a strong indicator of the impact of the disaster.\nDisasters can overwhelm local medical examiners and emergency systems, disrupting typical reporting methods. Most mortality surveillance data (such as Vital Statistics) are collected in a way that is not timely or detailed enough to be useful for disaster response. Thus, implementing active mortality surveillance following a disaster provides a critical aspect to response.\nCDC has several ready-to-use templates for morbidity and mortality surveillance. These tools can supplement existing surveillance systems or replace surveillance systems that have been hindered or destroyed due to a disaster. For more information, review theTools and Resourcespage.\nDuring disasters, several steps may need to be conducted simultaneously when planning a surveillance system. Just as purpose and objective should be clear in any disaster response effort, the surveillance system should have well-defined objectives. Additionally, data sources need to be identified and selected.\nFacility-based surveillance of hospitals and emergency medical operations can provide information on those seeking care during a disaster, yet there is often the need to use additional nontraditional sources of information (such as a shelters, pharmacies, or physician offices) as well. Ideally, data collection instruments for surveillance should be developed, tested, and distributed before the disaster occurs (e.g., CDC-developed surveillance tools). However, these instruments will need to be modified for each disaster and location.\nThe data collection instrument should collect only the most essential information and should have easy data entry. For information to be useful, it must be disseminated in a timely fashion through appropriate channels (e.g., public health and other government officials, relief workers, the affected community, and the media)."

Ash is gritty, abrasive, sometimes corrosive, and always unpleasant. Small ash particles can abrade (scratch) the front of the eye. Ash particles may contain crystalline silica, a material that causes a respiratory disease called silicosis.\nInfants, elderly people, and people with respiratory conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and other chronic lung diseases may have problems if they breathe in volcanic ash.\nMost gases from a volcano quickly blow away. However, heavy gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide can collect in low-lying areas. The most common volcanic gas is water vapor, followed by carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide.\nOther volcanic gases include hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen fluoride. Amounts of these gases vary widely from one volcanic eruption to the next.\nAlthough gases usually blow away rapidly, it is possible that people who are close to the volcano or who are in the low-lying areas downwind may be exposed to levels that may affect health.\nAt low levels, gases can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat.

They are computed when the population at risk of death for a specific occupation is not known.Learn more and see an example of how PMRs can be used.\nTo calculate a PMR, the proportion of deaths due to a specific cause for a group of workers is divided by the proportion of deaths due to that cause in all workers.\nPMRs can be computed for occupation or industry.\nA PMR greater than 100 indicates that a particular cause accounts for a greater proportion of deaths in the population of interest than is expected based on the proportion of deaths due to this cause in all workers.\nConfidence intervals that do not include 100 indicate that the PMR is unexpectedly high or low.\nPMRs can be computed when the underlying population at risk cannot be determined (lack of denominator data for calculating rates). For example, data can be analyzed by demographic subgroups including racial/ethnic groups to monitor for inequities.\nA PMR for one cause of death is dependent on other causes of death, if one cause of death is elevated other causes of death will be depressed.\nPMRs may bias risk estimates toward the null.\nAn elevated PMR does not indicate a direct causal relationship between the industry or occupation and the cause of death."

NBS also provides reporting jurisdictions with a NEDSS-compatible information system to transfer epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical data efficiently and securely over the Internet.\nBuilt and maintained by CDC, NBS integrates data from many sources on multiple public health conditions to help local, state, and territorial public health officials identify and track cases of disease over time. This capability allows public health to provide appropriate interventions to help limit the severity and spread of disease.\nNBS facilitates the adoption of national consensus standards used across public health and healthcare\u2014including vocabulary standards such as LOINC, SNOMED, and RXNORM and messaging standards such as HL7\u2014and helps local, state, and territorial public health departments use standards when sending information to CDC about notifiable diseases and conditions.\nCurrently, 25 health departments (20 states: CNMI; Guam; Puerto Rico; RMI; and U.S. Virgin Islands) use NBS to manage public health investigations and transfer general communicable disease surveillance data to CDC.\nNote: Mississippi is using NBS for COVID-19 only.\nNBS supports surveillance for any type of condition. However, it is primarily used for state reportable and nationally notifiable conditions, most of which are infectious diseases. Public health reporting jurisdictions, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and CDC work together to determine the list of conditions on an annual basis. Currently, more than 140 different diseases and conditions are tracked through NBS.\nData collected for surveillance purposes are used primarily at the local and state level to guide public health action. A subset of the data collected are sent to CDC to support surveillance at the national level. The data are used to\nThe primary goal of the first release of NBS was to support the electronic processes involved in state reportable and notifiable disease surveillance, investigation, and analysis and replace the functionality supported by the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS). CDC started development of NBS in 2001, and the first version of the application went live in the state of Nebraska in January 2003. Since then, the system has evolved into a modern disease surveillance, case management, and case notification system. It serves as a reference implementation of the NEDSS standards and living laboratory for testing implementation of best practices in public health surveillance systems.\nIntegrated surveillance information systems in reporting jurisdictions that are based on the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System architectural standards are primary data sources for the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).

The data underestimate the problem because the number of nonfatal injuries is limited to older adults who are treated in emergency departments. The information doesn\u2019t include those treated by other providers or those that do not need or do not seek treatment. Additionally, many cases are not reported because the older adult is afraid or unable to tell police, friends, or family about the violence.\nAbuse, including neglect and exploitation, is experienced by about 1 in 10 older adults who live at home.1From 2002 to 2016, more than 643,000 older adults were treated in the emergency department for nonfatal assaults and over 19,000 homicides occurred.2\nCompared with women, men had higher rates of both nonfatal assaults and homicides.23The rate for nonfatal assaults increased more than 75% among men (2002\u20132016) and more than 35% among women (2007\u20132016). The estimated homicide rate for men increased 7% from 2010 to 2016.2Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Black or African American persons, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Natives, and Hispanic or Latino persons have higher homicide rates (2002\u20132016).2\nOverall and firearm-specific older adult homicide rates increased between 2014 and 2017. Of the 6,188 victims, 62% were male. The perpetrator was an intimate partner in 39% of firearm homicides and 12% of non-firearm homicides. Common contexts of firearm homicides were familial or intimate partner problems, robbery or burglary, argument, and illness-related (e.g. the homicide was perpetrated to end the suffering of an ill victim, both victim and perpetrator had an illness, or the perpetrator had a mental illness).3\nThe economic cost of violent injuries against older adults is also substantial. A recent CDC study found that assault injuries to older adults in the United States cost almost $33 billion in 2022. This reflects a rise in both homicides and nonfatal assaults treated in emergency departments among older adults. Specifically, the rate of nonfatal assaults increased by 31%, while the rate of homicides rose by 26% between 2015 and 2022.4"

FoodNet also conducted surveillance forCryptosporidiumfrom 1997 through 2017. FoodNet began to collect information on infections identified by culture-independent methods in 2009 for STEC andCampylobacterand in 2011 forListeria,Salmonella,Shigella,Yersinia, andVibrio.\nFoodNet is an active surveillance system, meaning that public health officials routinely communicate with more than 700 clinical laboratories serving the surveillance area to identify new infections and conduct periodic audits to ensure that all infections are reported.\nFoodNet collects information on laboratory-diagnosed infections identified by culture orculture-independent diagnostic test (CIDT)for bacterial pathogens and microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for parasites. Personnel at each FoodNet site collect information about infections and share that information with CDC through FoodNet's database. The information includes\nFoodNet conducts surveillance for physician-diagnosedhemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)through a network of pediatric nephrologists and infection-control practitioners. FoodNet staff also review hospital discharge data for pediatric HUS cases to validate surveillance reports and identify additional cases by using ICD-9-CM/ICD-10 codes specifying HUS, acute renal failure with the hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with diarrhea caused by an unknown pathogen or E. coli.\nIn addition to routine surveillance, FoodNet occasionally conducts special surveillance projects. In 2002, two sites conducted population-based surveillance for reactive arthritis associated with Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and STEC infections. In 2009, FoodNet conducted a pilot surveillance program for community-acquiredClostridioides difficileinfections (formerly known asClostridium difficile) in Connecticut and New York. In 2010, FoodNet conducted a pilot surveillance program forCronobacter sakazakiiinfections in selected sites."

Leave the area until the gas has gone away.\nIf you cannot get away, go to the highest ground possible because chlorine is heavier than air and will sink.\nGet cleanby taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories and showering as soon as you can. Showering is the best method for removing chlorine from your body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.\nIf clothes are frozen to your body, do not try to remove until no longer frozen. Instead, begin washing with a lot of lukewarm water. Then remove your clothes.\nDo not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the chlorine from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag. Drop clothes to the floor.\nIf you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.\nWash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet, including armpits and groin, with lots of lukewarm water and mild soap for several minutes. Finish with a plain water rinse. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth.Do not scrub!\nIf your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10\u201315 minutes with lukewarm water.Do not use eye drops.\nDry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.\nIf emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.\nOtherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid through. Gather all used things from the floor and put them in a plastic bag, close it up, and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.\nDo not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch chlorine. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up.\nGet helpright away by calling 911, going to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave your home, or calling the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222."

This is because factor IX levels take more time to develop and are not at a normal level until a baby is at least 6 months of age.

Types of screening tests include the following:\nThis test measures the amount of hemoglobin (the red pigment inside red blood cells that carries oxygen), the size and number of red blood cells, and numbers of different types of white blood cells and platelets found in blood. The CBC might be normal in people with hemophilia. However, if a person with hemophilia has unusually heavy bleeding or bleeds for a long time, the hemoglobin and the red blood cell count can be low.\nThis test measures how long it takes for blood to clot. It measures the clotting ability of factors VIII (8), IX (9), XI (11), and XII (12). If any of these clotting factors is too low, it takes longer than normal for the blood to clot. The results of this test will show a longer clotting time among people with hemophilia A or B.\nThis test also measures the time it takes for blood to clot. It measures primarily the clotting ability of factors I (1), II (2), V (5), VII (7), and X (10). If any of these factors are too low, it takes longer than normal for the blood to clot. The results of this test will be normal among most people with hemophilia A and B.\nThis test also helps doctors assess a patient's ability to form a blood clot. This test is ordered either along with other blood clotting tests or when a patient has an abnormal PT or APTT test result, or both. Fibrinogen is another name for clotting factor I.\nClotting factor tests, also called factor assays, determine the clotting activity of factors VIII and IX in the blood. Factors VIII and IX are proteins in the blood that help form clots and stop bleeding. Clotting factor tests are required to diagnose a bleeding disorder and will show the type of hemophilia and the severity.

And it's not known if people can even get infected with CWD. However, CWD is related to another prion disease in animals thatdoesinfect people. So, it is considered a theoretical risk to people.\nSome studies in monkeys suggest they can get CWD by eating meat or brain tissues of infected deer or elk. These studies raise concerns CWD may also pose a risk to people."

Since then, the disease has been reported in wild deer in more than half of U.S. states. It's possible that CWD is also in other states but hasn't been reported yet. Once the disease is established in an area, the CWD prions can stay in the environment (soil) for years.\nIf CWD could spread to people, it would most likely be by eating meat from an infected animal. ACDC surveyof U.S. residents showed nearly 1 in 5 said they had hunted deer or elk. More than 6 in 10 said they had eaten venison or elk meat. These groups would likely be most at risk if CWD spreads to people."

In rare cases, the proteins misfold, causing serious symptoms in the animal or person affected. Once a person or animal gets sick, the disease moves to the brain and spine and eventually leads to death.\nScientists believe CWD proteins (prions) spread between animals through body fluids like feces, saliva, blood, or urine. This can occur either through direct contact or indirectly through contamination of soil, food or water."

If your deer is processed commercially, consider asking to have your animal be processed individually. This ensures you are only getting meat from your animal. If your animal tests positive for CWD, do not eat meat from that animal."

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist climates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected populations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and effective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in the affected communities.\nSoil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's intestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when infected people defecate (poop) outside, useunimproved sanitation facilities(when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as fertilizer.\nSoil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites globally.

These people often receive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or \"preventive chemotherapy\".\nThe high-risk groups identified by the World Health Organization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and adults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs often provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger children.\nTreatment of soil-transmitted helminths and other \"neglected tropical diseases\" (NTDs) sometimes use mass drug administration (MDA). MDA treats multiple people, sometimes whole communities, or schools, at one time. The drugs used in MDA are safe and inexpensive or donated and offered to entire risk groups to prevent these diseases."

Work with pet store staff to decide if a fresh or saltwater tank is right for you. Saltwater tanks need more maintenance than freshwater tanks.\nMatch the size of the tank to the space available in your home and to the amount of time you have to maintain it.\nConsider purchasing a second aquarium to be used when you're cleaning your first tank, or to house new fish before you place them in your established tank. Having a second tank to temporarily house fish may help reduce their stress and disease.\nOnce you've decided what type of aquarium you want, learn how to set it up properly.\nAsk your veterinarian about the proper setup for your aquarium, the types of fish you should keep, as well as food, care, and environmental requirements for your fish.\nBefore bringing fish home, make sure your aquarium is ready. Ask your veterinarian about \"cycling a tank\" to get the bacteria and nitrogen levels balanced.\nLearn which fish can go in the aquarium you have. Most fish live in either saltwater or freshwater, not both.\nConsider the number of fish to keep in your tank; a good standard is 1 inch of fish per gallon of water.\nDon't forget to research which species of fish can be in the same tank together and what types of food they will need. Some types of fish, like male betta fish, can't be in the same aquarium together because they will fight.\nPick fish that are active in their tanks in the pet store. Compare the fish to those of the same type around it. Is it acting like the others or is it off by itself? Is it able to swim normally?\nDon't select fish from a tank that has a high number of dead fish.\nHealthy fish should have smooth, sleek, shiny scales that aren't discolored. Their bodies should not have any bumps, and their fins should be intact.\nWhen bringing a new fish home, it's very important to acclimate it to your aquarium water. Purchased fish will often be given to you in a clear bag with water from their tank at the store. This water will be a different temperature than your aquarium water at home.\nTo acclimate your fish:\nCheck your fish daily for signs of illness.

This will help prevent other fish in your main aquarium from getting sick.\nTalk to a veterinarian experienced in fish medicine if you have questions about your pet's health.\nPromptly remove any dead fish from your aquarium so disease doesn't spread to other fish.\nEven though fish appear healthy, they may still spread germs to humans. If you become sick shortly after purchasing new fish or cleaning your aquarium, make sure to tell your healthcare provider that you have a pet fish.\nFind a new home for your fish:"

The following facts are based on data from the United States.\nYouth violence is common. Homicide is the third leading cause of death for young people ages 10-24. It is the leading cause of death for non-Hispanic Black or African American youth.12Emergency departments treat over 800 young people for physical assault-related injuries each day.1\nSome youth are at greater risk than others. Sexual minority teens are more likely to experience multiple forms of violence compared to their heterosexual peers.1Black or African American youth and young adults are at higher risk for the most physically harmful forms of violence. This includes homicides, fights with injuries, and aggravated assaults.2\nYouth violence is costly. In 2020, youth homicides and nonfatal physical assault-related injuries resulted in an estimated $122 billion annually. These costs include medical care, lost work, and quality of life. This estimate does not include costs to the criminal justice system.3\nCOVID-19 has impacted the economic burden of youth violence. Compared to 2019, the economic burden of youth violence was 17% higher in 2020 ($122 billion vs. $105 billion).3"

It can also contribute to decreased connections to peers and adults, and trouble coping with stress.1\nYouth violence is linked to negative health and well-being outcomes and disproportionately impacts communities of color.1Violence increases the risk for behavioral and mental health difficulties. These can include future violence perpetration and victimization. Other outcomes include smoking, substance use, obesity, high-risk sexual behavior, depression, academic difficulties, school dropout, and suicide.1\nViolence increases health care costs, decreases property value, negatively impacts school attendance, and decreases access to community support services. Addressing the short- and long-term consequences of violence strains community resources. As a result, this limits the resources that states and communities can use to address other needs."

It is important for prevention efforts to consider societal conditions disproportionately experienced by Black or African American youth and young adults. This includes conditions like concentrated poverty and residential segregation. It also includes other forms of racism that limit opportunities to grow up in healthy, violence-free environments. Addressing the root causes of violence is critical to reducing high rates of violence in communities of color.2"

The last outbreak in the United States in people was in 1987, and since then, there have only been five cases of western equine encephalitis virus identified in the United States. The last reported case of western equine encephalitis occurred in 1999.

This report also highlights the latest scientific evidence on the health benefits of quitting smoking, as well as proven treatments and strategies to help people successfully quit smoking.\nFind individual chapters, consumer guides, fact sheets, infographics, and videoshere.\nDownload the full2020 Surgeon General's ReportorExecutive Summary.\n2016\u2014E-Cigarette Use Among Youth and Young Adults\nThis is the first report issued by a federal agency to comprehensively review the public health issue of electronic cigarettes and their impact on our nation\u2019s young people. The report highlights the rapidly changing patterns of e-cigarette use among youth and young adults, assesses what is known about the health effects of using these products, and describes strategies that tobacco companies use to recruit youth and young adults to try or continue using e-cigarettes. The report also outlines interventions that can be adopted to minimize the harm these products cause to our nation\u2019s youth.\n2014\u2014The Health Consequences of Smoking: 50 Years of ProgressThis report highlights the progress our nation has made reducing tobacco use in the 50 years since the first Surgeon General\u2019s Report on Smoking and Health. It outlines the continuing burden of disease and death caused by smoking, and identifies additional diseases and conditions causally related to secondhand smoke exposure.\n2012\u2014Preventing Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young AdultsThis report adds to our knowledge about the prevalence, causes, effects, and implications of tobacco use by young people. It details the factors that lead youth and young adults to initiate tobacco use, and the devastating health and economic impact of that decision on our nation as well as on individuals, their families, and their communities. This report also identifies proven, effective strategies that have the potential to dramatically reduce tobacco use.\n2010\u2014How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease: The Biology and Behavioral Basis for Smoking-Attributable DiseaseThis report is a comprehensive, scientific discussion of how tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke exposure, damages the human body. The report focuses on cigarettes and cigarette smoke to show how cigarettes cause addiction and death. It includes effective interventions for tobacco control and prevention.\n2006\u2014The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco SmokeThis report  updates the evidence about the harmful effects of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke. It shows that smoke-free policies are the most economical and effective approach to protecting others from exposure to secondhand smoke. Research shows that restriction of smoking to protect people who do not smoke has had the additional health impact of reducing the number of smokers in the U.S."

Asthma attacks can be caused by \"triggers\" such as respiratory infections, allergy particles, chemical irritants, and air pollution. During an asthma attack, a person with asthma can experience symptoms such as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and nighttime or early morning coughing.

These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu,get tested, especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.\nDifferent respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.\nYou can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall.\nYou can take steps to reduce your risk of getting a respiratory virus or spreading one to others.

Although bleach (hypochlorite) is often recommended for the decontamination purposes, it is not effective with all classes of agents. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that cleaning with bleach solutions will destroy all types of antineoplastic agents.\nThere is a limited amount of evidence in the literature concerning occupational cancer related to antineoplastic agents.\nThe most often used type of protective equipment for handling antineoplastic agents is gloves. Typically, latex and other materials have been employed for this use. However, with the concern over latex allergies, newer materials are being marketed and evaluated for use with these agents. Protective gowns are another piece of equipment that is commonly used in the handling of antineoplastic agents.\nSince it was first recognized that occupational exposure to antineoplastic agents posed a potential health risk to workers exposed to these agents, various groups, institutions and agencies around the world have developed and published guidelines or recommendations for handling antineoplastic agents.\nOver the past several years, the direct measurement of antineoplastic agents in body fluids of healthcare workers has been employed to assess exposure to these agents. Methods for a number of the more common agents are included in the citations on this page. Currently, these techniques are only used in research settings and not for routine monitoring of healthcare workers."

CDC analyzed reports to theVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)to search for any side effects that might have been caused by the irregularity, and found none. Any time such an irregularity is found in a vaccine lot which could make it unsafe, the manufacturer, in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will recall it immediately. Information on recalled lots of is available by year fromFDA."

        "content": "HHT is a disorder in which some blood vessels do not develop properly. A person with HHT may form abnormal capillaries or abnormal capillary connections between the arteries and veins. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that pass blood from arteries to veins. The abnormal blood vessels formed in HHT are often fragile and can burst, causing bleeding. Men, women, and children from all racial and ethnic groups can be affected by HHT and experience the problems associated with this disorder, some of which are serious and potentially life-threatening. Fortunately, if HHT is discovered early, effective treatments are available. However, there is no cure for HHT.\nNosebleeds are the most common sign of HHT, resulting from small abnormal blood vessels within the inside layer of the nose. Abnormal blood vessels in the skin can appear on the hands, fingertips, face, lips, lining of the mouth, and nose as delicate red or purplish spots that lighten briefly when touched. Bleeding within the stomach or intestines is another possible indicator of HHT that occurs because of abnormal blood vessels lining the digestive tract. Additional signs of HHT include abnormal artery-vein connections within the brain, lungs, and liver, which often do not display any warning signs before rupturing.\nHHT is a genetic disorder. Each person with HHT has a gene that is altered (mutated), which causes HHT. It takes only one gene with a mutation to cause HHT. Hundreds of possible mutations in several different genes have been linked to HHT.\nHHT can be diagnosed by performing genetic testing. Most people with HHT are first diagnosed by using clinical criteria (presence of signs and a history of signs in a parent, sibling, or child).\nThe complications of HHT can vary widely, even among people affected by HHT in the same family. Complications and treatment of HHT depend on the parts of the body that are affected by this disorder. Treatment may include controlling bleeding and anemia and preventing complications from abnormal artery-vein connections in the lungs and brain."

Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.\nIf your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.\nIf you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).\nIf you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.\nIf possible, put the clothing in a plastic bag. Then put the first plastic bag in a second plastic bag.

On the other hand, there may be an increase in \"presenteeism.\" Presenteeism is when workers show up to work sick.\nOverall, older workers tend to experience fewer workplace injuries than their younger colleagues. This difference may be due to their experience or because they are more careful and aware of their physical limitations.\nOlder workers often require more time to heal from workplace injuries. It is important for employers to have a well-planned return to work program.\nOlder workers experience a higher rate of workplace fatalities.

ART also includes egg and embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and egg and embryo donation. The most common type of ART is in vitro fertilization (IVF). Other types of ART, such as gamete intrafallopian transfer or zygote intrafallopian transfer, are rarely performed.\nART does NOT include treatments in which only sperm are handled (such as intrauterine insemination). It also does NOT include procedures in which a woman takes drugs only to stimulate egg production without planning to have the eggs surgically retrieved."

The bacteria spread from person to person through the air. People with symptoms haveactiveTB and can spread the disease. The risk of developing active TB is greatest in the first few years after infection. However, some risk remains throughout life.\nExamples of ways people with active TB release bacteria into the air include:\nThe small droplets containing the bacteria quickly dry into tiny particles called droplet nuclei. The nuclei can remain suspended in air for long periods of time and other people can breathe the particles into their lungs. Becoming infected with TB typically requires an extended amount of time sharing a space with a person who has active TB. However, in rare cases the infection has been documented after short exposures.\nPeople who have been infected but do not have symptoms havelatentTB infection and are not contagious. Once infected, most people's immune system can control the infection. However, they are not able to completely eliminate it without taking a proper course of anti-TB drugs. Depending on the level of infection and strain of bacteria, anti-TB drug regimens can last from 4 months to over a year. Without treatment, latent TB can develop into active TB and become contagious.\nTB is preventable and treatable in most cases. It can usually be cured by available anti-TB drugs. Infection control practices can help reduce the spread of TB.Treatment for latent TB infectioncan prevent others from developing active TB. Persons with drug-resistant strains can recover using alternative regimens of medications, except in extreme cases."

Prenatal screening for some infections (HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus) is recommended for all pregnant women. Screening for other infections (chlamydia, gonorrhea, and TB) is recommended for some women at risk for infection."

        "content": "To protect all women and infants, CDC recommends the following:\nHepatitis B Virus Infection (HBV)\nAll pregnant women should be screened during each pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester, regardless of vaccination status or history of testing. Pregnant women with a history of appropriately timed triple panel screening and without subsequent risk for exposure to HBV (i.e., no new HBV exposures since triple panel screening) only need hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening. Testing pregnant women known to be chronically infected or immune enables documentation of the HBsAg test result during that pregnancy to ensure timely prophylaxis for exposed infants. Newborns of pregnant women who are HBsAg positive should receive the HepB vaccine and HepB immune globulin at birth and complete the HepB vaccine series according to the recommended vaccination schedule.\nHepatitis C Virus Infection (HCV)\nAll pregnant women should be tested for hepatitis C during each pregnancy. While there is no treatment available to prevent transmission of HCV infection from mother to child, screening for HCV infection during pregnancy allows health care providers to identify infected women who should receive treatment during the postpartum period and infants who should receive testing during a pediatric visit. Identification of HCV infection during pregnancy also can inform pregnancy and delivery management issues that might reduce the risk of HCV transmission to the infant.\nHIV\nAll pregnant women should be tested for HIV as early as possible, preferably at the first prenatal visit. The earlier HIV is diagnosed and treated, the more effective HIV medicines \u2014 called antiretroviral therapy or ART \u2014 can be at preventing transmission and improving the health outcomes of both mother and child.\nSyphilis\nAll pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the first prenatal visit, ideally during the first trimester of pregnancy. Among women who may be less likely to receive prenatal care, consider testing at the time of pregnancy testing. The earlier syphilis is diagnosed and treated during pregnancy, the more likely congenital syphilis and its complications (such as stillbirth) can be prevented in the infant. Penicillin G is effective for preventing maternal transmission to the fetus, as well as treating fetal and maternal infection. Pregnant women who live in communities with high rates of syphilis, who are at high risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g., substance use or a new sex partner), or who were not previously tested during the pregnancy should also be screened again at 28 weeks and at delivery.\nTuberculosis (TB)\nHealthcare providers should assess all persons, including pregnant women, for risk factors associated withlatent TB infectionandTB disease. While universal testing for latent TB infection and TB disease is not recommended for pregnant women in the United States, targeted testing for those with risk factors, including people living with HIV infection, people born in high TB prevalence countries, and those who are known contacts of persons with TB disease, facilitates prompt initiation of curative treatment for those with TB disease."

The mold produces spores that are easily aerosolized (2). The spores are inhaled by the host and are settled into the lungs (3), where they are phagocytosed by the host's alveolar macrophages (4). The higher body temperature (at 37\u00b0C) triggers a morphologic change from the mold to a yeast form, which uniquely divides by binary fission forming a characteristic midline septum (5). The yeasts multiply until they cause rupture of the macrophage (6), releasing yeasts that can spread within the lungs and can disseminate to other organs. At the demise of the hosts, the yeast returns to the mold, in abundance, and the cycle repeats."

Do not put contact lenses back in.\nFollow these steps to blot your body:\nRepeat the process several times if you still feel liquid on you. Use a different clean cloth or towel for each part of your body. Use a different clean cloth or towel each time you repeat the process.\nUse lukewarm water and mild soap to wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body for about 90 seconds. Wash from your head to your feet, including armpits and groin. Use soapy water for a minute, then rinse with plain water for 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth.Do not scrub!\nIf your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10 to 15 minutes with lukewarm water.Do not use eye drops.\nDry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.\nIf emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.\nOtherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.\nDo not put the bags in the regular trash!

In some cases, a genetic change in a single gene can cause someone to have a disease or condition. In other cases, the gene does not have a genetic change, but a person has more or fewer copies of the gene than most people, and this causes a disease or condition. Some diseases or conditions occur when a person does not have the same number of chromosomes as most people or has part of a chromosome that is missing, extra, or not in the right place.\nMost genetic disorders happen due to the combination of many genetic changes acting together with a person's behaviors and environment. These are sometimes called complex conditions.\nA detailed description of the basic concepts of genetics can be foundhere."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Single gene disorders",
        "content": "DNA contains the instructions for making your body work. DNA is made up of two strands that wind around each other. Each DNA strand includes chemicals called nitrogen bases\u2014T (thymine), A (adenine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine)\u2014that make up the DNA code. Genes are specific sections of DNA that have instructions for making proteins. Proteins make up most of the parts of your body and make your body work the right way.\nSome diseases and conditions happen when a person has a genetic change (sometimes called a mutation) in one of their genes. These types of diseases are called single gene disorders. Sometimes, what happens is that one of the DNA bases is changed. For example, part of a gene that usually has the sequence TAC is changed to the sequence TTC. This can change the way the gene works, for example, by changing the protein that is made. In other cases, one or more of the bases in the DNA sequence are missing altogether, or there are extra bases.\nGenetic changes can be passed down to a child from their parents. When this happens, the disease or condition is called hereditary or inherited. Or the changes can happen for the first time in the process of making the sperm or egg or early in development, so the child will have the genetic change but the parents will not.\nSingle gene disorders that affect a gene on one of the 22 autosomal chromosome pairs are called autosomal disorders. Disorders that affect the sex chromosome are called X-linked disorders. Disorders are further described according to whether the affected genetic change is dominant or recessive.\nFor some diseases and conditions, everyone who inherits the genetic change will have the disease or condition, but how serious it is can vary from person to person. In other cases, people who have the genetic change will be more likely to develop the disease or condition, but some of them will never develop it.\nWith autosomal dominant diseases or conditions, a person only needs a genetic change in one copy of the gene to have the disease. If one parent has an autosomal dominant disease or condition, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the genetic change that causes the condition.\nExamples of autosomal dominant conditions include hereditary breast and ovarian cancer caused by genetic changes (mutations) to theBRCA1andBRCA2genes;Lynch syndrome; andfamilial hypercholesterolemia.\nWith autosomal recessive diseases or conditions, a person needs a genetic change in both copies of the gene to have the disease or condition. While a person with a genetic change in only one copy of the gene will not have the disease or condition, they can still pass the genetic change down to their children. These parents are sometimes called \"carriers\" of the disease because they \"carry\" the genetic change that causes the disease or condition but do not have the disease themselves.\nA parent who is a carrier of a disease has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of passing the gene with the genetic change on to each of their children. If both parents are carriers of the disease, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of inheriting two genes with the genetic change and thus of having the disease. Carrier screening looks for autosomal recessive genetic changes in parents to see if they could have a child with the disease or condition.\nExamples of autosomal recessive disorders aresickle celldisease andcystic fibrosis.\nFemales have two X chromosomes, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Each daughter gets an X from her mother and an X from her father. Each son gets an X from his mother and a Y from his father.\nSome diseases or conditions happen when a gene on the X chromosome has a genetic change. Because males only have one copy of all the genes on the X chromosome, they are much more likely to be affected by X-linked genetic disorders than females. A female with a genetic change on only one of her two X chromosomes may not have the disease or condition at all. However, in some cases, females with the genetic change on one of their X chromosomes can have the disease or condition, but it is often a milder form of the disease than usually occurs in males.\nBecause males inherit an X chromosome from their mother, a female with a genetic change on one copy of the gene has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of passing the genetic change on to each of her sons. Her sons could have the disease or condition even though she does not.\nExamples of X-linked conditions includefragile X syndrome,Duchenne muscular dystrophy, andhereditary hemophilia."

        "heading": "Chromosomal abnormalities",
        "content": "People usually have 23 pairs of chromosomes. But sometimes a person is born with a different number. Having an extra chromosome is called trisomy. Missing a chromosome is called monosomy.\nFor example, people withDown syndromehave an extra copy of chromosome 21. This extra copy changes the body's and brain's normal development and causes intellectual and physical problems for the person. Some disorders are caused by having a different number of sex chromosomes. For example, people withTurner syndromeusually have only one sex chromosome, an X. Women with Turner syndrome can have problems with growth and heart defects.\nSometimes chromosomes are incomplete or shaped differently than usual. Missing a small part of a chromosome is called a deletion. A translocation is when part of one chromosome has moved to another chromosome. An inversion is when part of a chromosome has been flipped over.\nFor example, people withWilliams syndromeare missing a small part of chromosome 7. This deletion can result in intellectual disability and a distinctive facial appearance and personality."

        "content": "Complex disorders are caused by genetic changes in many different genes working together with environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposures and behaviors such as air pollution, smoking, alcohol use, the amount of exercise a person gets, or the foods they eat. Having a family health history of a complex condition can make you more likely to have that condition yourself. However, genetic testing would not be recommended because there is not a single genetic change causing the condition that could be found by genetic testing.\nMost chronic diseases, such as most cases ofheart disease,cancer,diabetes,osteoporosis, andasthma, are complex disorders. So are most cases of developmental disabilities, such asautism spectrum disorderandattention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and mental health conditions, such asdepressionandschizophrenia.\nThe vast amount of genetic information available has allowed researchers to develop methods to study which types of genetic changes are found more often in people with a given disease or condition. This allows researchers to estimate a person's risk for a particular disorder based on which genetic changes they have. This estimate is known as the polygenic risk score.\nSome important issues need to be considered before polygenic risk scores can be routinely used in health care and public health. Studies are looking at how useful polygenic risk scores are in real-life clinical practice. Information on how each gene change affects disease risk comes from population-level genetic studies. Addressing diversity in development of polygenic risk scores is important, because polygenic risk scores developed from studies in one population (for example, people of Northern European ancestry) might not work as well for other populations (for example, people of West African ancestry). Also, how each gene change affects the polygenic risk score varies from study to study.\nOnce polygenic risk scores are ready to be used routinely in clinical practice, public health efforts will be needed to address issues such as access, insurance coverage, and sharing of results across health systems."

Apheresis is a treatment like dialysis in which a machine removes Lp(a) and LDL-cholesterol from the blood.\nIf you have high Lp(a) levels, you should take steps to lower your LDL-cholesterol if it is high. Some studies4suggest that medications called statins might slightly raise Lp(a) levels but are still recommended due to their effects in lowering LDL-cholesterol and reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral arterial disease. If you have FH, coronary artery disease, or peripheral arterial disease, your healthcare provider might recommend also taking a medication called PCSK9 inhibitors to further lower your LDL level. While a healthy lifestyle will not lower Lp(a) levels, it does impact LDL levels, so people with high Lp(a) should keep a healthy weight, not smoke, choose healthy foods and drinks, and get regular physical activity.

They first found influenza A in bats in little yellow-shouldered bats.1\nBat influenza viruses have since been detected in some other species of bats in Central and South America.2\nThe discovery of bat influenza viruses is important for public health because bats represent a new animal species that may act as a source of influenza viruses. Influenza viruses are already known to spread and cause disease in other animals.\nLaboratory research conducted at CDC and elsewhere suggests that bat influenza viruses would need to change significantly to be able to infect and spread easily among humans."

        "content": "CDC laboratory research suggests bat influenza viruses would need to undergo significant changes to become capable of infecting and spreading easily among people. Therefore, these viruses do not appear to pose a risk to human health in their current form. However, CDC scientists cannot rule out the possibility that these viruses could eventually become capable of infecting humans. The internal genes of bat influenza viruses are compatible with human influenza viruses. That means it is possible that these viruses could exchange genetic information with human influenza viruses through a process called \"reassortment.\"\nReassortment occurs when two or more influenza viruses infect a single host cell, which allows the viruses to swap genetic information.\nThe conditions needed for reassortment between human influenza viruses and bat influenza viruses remain unknown. A different animal (such as pigs, horses, dogs, or seals) would need to serve as a \"bridge.\" That means that another animal would need to be capable of being infected with both bat influenza virus and human influenza viruses for reassortment to occur.\nSince the discovery of bat flu, there has been at least one study to assess the possibility of reassortment events occurring between bat influenza and other influenza viruses.3\nSo far, the results of these studies continue to indicate that bat influenza viruses are very unlikely to reassort with other influenza viruses. Preliminary laboratory research at CDC suggests that human cells do not support growth of bat influenza viruses.1\nThe bat influenza viruses discovered in Central and South America are very different from other influenza viruses in humans and animals. All influenza A viruses have hemagglutinin (HA) surface proteins. Until the discovery of bat influenza viruses, there were only 16 different classes (or \u201csubtypes\u201d) of HA proteins known to exist in nature.\nThe new bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America are distinct from pre-existing subtypes. CDC scientists have classified them as new subtypes, denoted as \u201cH17\u201d and \u201cH18.\u201d12\nThe other surface protein-coding gene of bat influenza viruses, neuraminidase (NA), is different from that of known influenza viruses, as well. CDC scientists have proposed new designations for the NA subtypes found in bats: \u201cN10\u201d and \u201cN11.\u201d\nThe discovery of bat flu has shed light on the evolution of influenza A, B, and C viruses. It is possible that many of the internal genes of bat influenza viruses are descendants of influenza virus families that once circulated more widely in previous centuries and that are now extinct, or yet to be discovered.\nUsing a process called phylogenic analysis, comparisons between different bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America have shown that there is considerable genetic diversity between them. Some researchers concluded that in Central and South American bat populations, the bat influenza viruses may have as much genetic diversity as those found in the influenza viruses of all other mammal and bird species combined.\nThese conclusions suggest that bat influenza viruses have been evolving in bats over a very long time, potentially centuries.2"

Rectal swabs and tissues were collected from each of the bats.\nVideos showing how specimens are collected from bats in Guatemala are available:\"Global Disease Detectives\"and\"CDC Global Disease Detectives: Clues From a Bat Cave.\"\nSwabs that were negative for rabies were analyzed by the Pathogen Discovery Program in CDC's Division of Viral Diseases to detect other pathogenic viruses. Initial viral screening determined that 3 of the 316 bats tested positive for influenza. All were from a single species known as little yellow-shouldered bats.\nThe Pathogen Discovery Program was able to identify and sequence the complete genome of the new viruses using high-throughput sequencing instruments in the laboratory."

Regardless of the setting and objectives, once the decision to conduct the CASPER has been made, it should be initiated as soon as possible.

Keep in mind that preparing for a CASPER can take several hours (e.g., during a response) or, if time allows, several months (e.g., in a non-disaster setting).\nCASPER is conducted through face-to-face interviews in the field. There are several advantages to conducting face-to-face interviews. These include a high response rate and the ability to distribute health information or other materials to the community.\nFace-to-face interviews have the additional benefit of directly connecting the community to local staff, increasing the visibility of and trust in the health department. Interview teams can also provide anecdotal information (e.g., direct visual inspection of a disaster-affected area, common concerns overheard in the community not captured in the questionnaire) that can help guide response and recovery efforts, implementation of any recommendations, and future plans.\nData from the questionnaire can be entered into any statistical software package that allows for multistage sample design weighting. CDC recommends using Epi Info\u2122, which is user-friendly, does not require computer permissions for download, and is available free of charge. Access tutorials and guidance onEpi Info\u2122. Data from the tracking form can be entered into any spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel.\nDisseminating findings is a vital component of a CASPER.

Go to the highest ground possible, because tabun is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas.\nIf tabun was released indoors, get out of the building.\nRemove the clothing with tabun on it as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, avoid touching unsafe areas.\nPut your clothing inside a plastic bag. Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.\nWhen the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.\nFor more information about cleaning your body and throwing away your clothes after a chemical exposure, visit \"About Getting Clean.\"\nWash any liquid tabun from your skin with lots of soap and water.

This is a measure of the distance around the baby's head. The provider then compares this measurement to population standards usingCDC charts(based on age and sex) orINTERGROWTH 21st(based on age, sex, and pregnancy duration). Microcephaly is a head circumference that is significantly smaller than the average for babies of the same age and sex.\nCommonly used birth head circumference reference charts are based on measurements taken before 24 hours of age. So, it is common to measure a baby's head circumference in the first 24 hours.\nHead circumference measurements may be influenced by factors related to delivery that might alter the shape of the baby's head. If the baby's head was affected by the delivery, a provider might wait longer than 24 hours. Widely accepted head circumference charts are theWHO chartsfor 0-2 years.\nIf the healthcare provider suspects microcephaly, he or she can request tests to help confirm the diagnosis and look for other problems. For example, magnetic resonance imaging can provide information on the structure of the baby's brain."

Employers and occupational safety and health professionals can use this information to take precautionary measures to minimize exposure to workers from these hazards. These measures can include elimination, substitution with less hazardous chemicals, engineering controls, and the use of personal protective equipment.\nNIOSH uses risk assessments in authoritative recommendations to reduce hazardous exposures to workers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has incorporated NIOSH risk assessments into workplace standards. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also used NIOSH risk assessments to support environmental assessments. State agencies and other entities setting occupational exposure limits have used NIOSH recommendations based on risk assessments.\nNIOSH work on risk assessment methods has had an impact on the field of risk assessment by expanding the methods available and better characterizing exposure-response model uncertainty. Risk assessment methods development is a critical focus to provide the most statistically sound risk assessments. Methods to improve risk assessment modeling and characterization of model uncertainty include model averaging and semi-parametric modeling. These methods are important to assessing risk as often data regarding a particular hazard are scarce; these methods allow NIOSH staff to maximize the utility of available data."

These include microwave popcorn, bakery mix, and flavoredcoffeeindustries.\nWorkplace exposure to diacetyl has been associated with severe respiratory impairment. It is also associated with a lung disease called obliterative bronchiolitis. The disease is also called constrictive bronchiolitis and bronchiolitis obliterans.\nObliterative bronchiolitis causes scarring and constriction in the lung's airways blocking air movement. Obliterative bronchiolitis cannot be cured. Like diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione has also had similar respiratory effects in animal studies.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration evaluated flavoring chemicals and determined they are \"generally recognized as safe\" to eat. However, workers can be exposed to flavoring chemicals in different ways and quantities than the general consumer. These chemicals can be harmful for food and chemical industry workers who breath contaminated air.\nMuch remains unknown about flavoring-related chemicals. Identifying which specific substances contribute to flavorings-related lung disease is challenging. Flavoring mixtures are complex and health data for many chemicals are unavailable.\nThe flavorings industry has estimated over a thousand flavoring chemicals as potential hazards.

        "content": "Did you know a baby can get some disease protection from their mom during pregnancy? Gettingflu,Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis),respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),andCOVID-19vaccines while you're pregnant helps your body createprotective antibodies (proteins produced by the body to fight off diseases), and you can pass on those antibodies to your baby. These antibodies can help protect your baby from those diseases during the first few months of life.\nCDC and a panel of experts who make vaccine recommendations have concluded that flu, Tdap, RSV, and COVID-19 vaccines are not harmful for pregnant women and their babies. These experts carefully reviewed the available safety data before recommending any vaccines during pregnancy.\nVaccines, like medicine, can have side effects. But most people who get vaccinated have mild or no side effects.CDC continually monitors vaccine safety, and the most common side effects of these vaccines include fever, tiredness, and body aches, as well as redness, swelling, and tenderness at the site where the shot was given.\nYou'll need a Tdap vaccine during your pregnancy, with optimal timing between the 27th through 36th week of each pregnancy, preferably during the earlier part of this time period. Tdap helps protect againstwhooping cough (pertussis), whichcan be life-threatening for newborns.\nAbout half of babies younger than 1 year old who get whooping cough need treatment in the hospital. The younger a baby is when they get whooping cough, the more likely the baby will need to be treated in a hospital. While some babies cough a lot, other babies with whooping cough don't cough at all. Instead, it can cause them to stop breathing and turn blue. Siblings, parents, or caregivers who don't know they have whooping cough can infect babies since the disease often causes only mild symptoms in older children and adults.\nChanges in your immune, heart, and lung functions during pregnancy make you more likely to get seriously ill from flu. Pregnancy increases the risk of being hospitalized with the flu and having flu-related complications if you get sick with the flu. Flu may also be dangerous for your pregnancy. Fever during pregnancy, for any reason, has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nAdditionally, babies are more likely to get very sick from flu. Flu vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older. When you get a flu vaccine during pregnancy, you pass antibodies along to your baby that can help protect them from flu in the first few months after they're born, when they are too young to be vaccinated themselves.\nGet a flu shot if you are pregnant during flu season\u2014it's the best way to protect yourself and your baby from flu. Flu vaccine is safe during pregnancy and can be given during any trimester.\nRSVis a common cause of severe respiratory illness in infants. Babies infected with RSV can have difficulty breathing and eating and sometimes may need respiratory support or hydration in the hospital. There are two ways to protect your baby from getting very sick with RSV. You can choose to get RSV vaccine during weeks 32 through 36 of your pregnancy during September to January, or your baby aged 8 months or younger can get RSV immunization during their first RSV season.\nIf you are pregnant or were recently pregnant, you are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 than women who are not pregnant. Additionally, if you have COVID-19 during pregnancy, you are more likely to have complications that can affect your pregnancy and developing baby.\nCOVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, including women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or who might become pregnant in the future.Evidenceshows that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe and effective and suggests that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any known or potential risks. New data show that vaccination during pregnancy can help protect babies younger than 6 months old, when they are too young to be vaccinated themselves, from hospitalization due to COVID-19.\nEveryone, including women who are pregnant, should stayup to datewith their COVID-19 vaccines, including getting an updated vaccine when it's time to get one.\nYou know all about timing. Week after week, you are tracking your baby's growth and development and counting down the days until you meet your little one! When it comes to vaccines, timing is also important.\nNewborns do not yet have fully developed immune systems, making them particularly vulnerable to infections.Older kids and adults can spread viruses to babies, even if they don't feel very sick. Because of this, anyone who is around babies should be up to date on all recommended vaccines. This includes parents, siblings, and any other caregivers, like grandparents, or babysitters. Anyone who needs vaccines should get them at least two weeks before meeting the baby because it takes about two weeks to develop antibodies after vaccination.\nThe amount of antibodies you have in your body after getting vaccinated decreases over time. When you get a vaccine during one pregnancy, your antibody levels may not stay high enough to provide enough protection during future pregnancies, even if your babies are close in age. So, make sure you give baby number 2 (and 3 and 4\u2026) the greatest amount of protective antibodies and the best disease protection possible by getting your Tdap vaccine each time you are pregnant. You should also get a flu shot every flu season, and stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines."

These illnesses are particularly challenging to test for and treat in populations in remote areas, in places that are medically underserved, and in communities adversely affected by health disparities. To help overcome these obstacles, AIP monitors disease prevalence in these areas (surveillance), conducts public health research, and continues to investigate more effective prevention and control strategies.\nAIP collaborates with Arctic partners on public health surveillance projects and research initiatives to help address climate-sensitive infectious disease threats. AIP and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium formed aOne Healthworking group to better understand and respond to issues at the interface of human, animal, and environmental health.

In some cases, skin sores from CL might heal on their own without treatment depending on the species involved.Leishmaniaskin sores can take months to years to heal and the sores can leave significant scars.\nFor theLeishmaniaspecies that cause ML, it is important to have proper treatment in order to prevent mucosal tissue destruction in the nose, mouth, or throat. Without treatment, ML can be life threatening if it affects the throat.\nIt is important to recognize and treat VL early. If not treated, severe (advanced) cases of VL are typically deadly.

This phase may last for two or three weeks.\nLater, when the parasite moves under the skin, people may experience swellings under the skin that may be painful, red, or itchy. The swellings move around and typically are not pitting. This means that if you push on the swelling with a finger, you will not see an indentation left behind. The swellings often begin within three to four weeks after ingestion of the parasite, but they can occur up to around 10 years after infection. The swellings typically last several weeks at a time.

We are currently down to one last recommended and effective class of antibiotics, cephalosporins, to treat this common infection. This is an urgent public health threat because gonorrhea control in the United States largely relies on our ability to successfully treat the infection.\nGonorrhea is skilled at outsmarting the antibiotics that are used to kill it.

The decline in culture testing results from an increased use of newer laboratory technology, such as a diagnostic test called the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT). Currently, there is no well-studied, reliable technology that allows for antibiotic susceptibility testing from nonculture specimens.

However, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, ciprofloxacin resistance was detected in Hawaii and the West Coast. By 2004, ciprofloxacin- resistant gonorrhea had significantly increased among men who have sex with men (MSM) leading to the discontinuation of the drug in this population. By 2006, nearly 14% of gonorrhea samples were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin resistance was present in all regions of the country and in the heterosexual population. On April 13, 2007, CDC stopped recommending fluoroquinolones as empiric treatment for gonorrhea altogether. The cephalosporins, either cefixime or ceftriaxone, were the only remaining recommended treatments.\nSimilar to trends observed elsewhere in the world, CDC observed worrisome trends of decreasing cephalosporin susceptibility. To preserve cephalosporins for as long as possible, CDC has updated itsSTI Treatment Guidelinesfrequently since 2010. Currently, just one regimen is recommended as first-line treatment for gonorrhea: a single 500 mg dose of the injectable cephalosporin, ceftriaxone.\nCDC continues to monitor resistance to cephalosporins and other drugs."

Humans have little immunity against new, non-human (novel) influenza A viruses. Infections in people with novel influenza A viruses are concerning when they occur. If these viruses acquire the ability to spread easily among people, it could result in a pandemic.\nFor this reason, the World Health Organization conducts global flu surveillance, which has led to detection of novel influenza A virus infections in humans. Surveillance focuses on novel influenza A viruses of animal origin (such as avian or swine influenza A viruses).\nThe signs of this illness in dogs include:\nHowever, not all dogs will show signs of illness. The severity of illness associated with canine flu in dogs can range from no signs to severe illness resulting in pneumonia and sometimes death.\nMost dogs recover from dog flu within 2 to 3 weeks. However, some dogs may develop secondary bacterial infections, which can lead to more severe illness and pneumonia. Anyone who has concerns about their pet's health, or whose pet is showing signs of dog flu, should contact their veterinarian.\nTesting is available to confirm canine influenza A(H3N2) virus infection in dogs. Your veterinarian can tell you if testing is appropriate."

H3N8 equine (horse) influenza (flu) viruses have been known to exist in horses for more than 40 years.\nIn 2004, cases of an unknown respiratory illness in dogs were reported in the United States. An investigation showed that this respiratory illness was caused by equine influenza viruses.\nScientists believe that after jumping from horses to dogs, the virus adapted to cause illness in dogs and spread among them. It spreads especially quickly among dogs housed in kennels and shelters. This is now considered a dog-specific (canine) H3N8 virus.\nIn September 2005, this virus was identified by experts as a \"newly emerging pathogen in the dog population\" in the United States. H3N8 canine influenza viruseshave not been reported since 2016and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore.\nCanine influenza H3N2 virusesoriginated in birds and spread to dogs. The first H3N2 canine influenza viruses were reported in 2004. There has also been reported spread of H3N2 canine influenza viruses from dogs to cats.\nH3N2 canine influenza viruses were first detected in dogs in South Korea in 2007. These viruses have also been reported in dogs in China, Thailand, and Canada.\nH3N2 canine influenza viruses were first detected in the United States inApril 2015. They have now been found in multiple U.S. states and regions. To date, the H3N2 canine viruses reported in the United States have been almost identical genetically to those previously reported in Asia."

        "heading": "Terms to know",
        "content": "DNA (which is short for deoxyribonucleic acid) contains the instructions for making your body work. DNA is made up of two strands that wind around each other and looks like a twisting ladder (a shape called a double helix). Each DNA strand includes chemicals called nitrogen bases, which make up the DNA code. There are four different bases, T (thymine), A (adenine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine). Each base on one strand of DNA is paired with a base on the other strand. The paired bases form the \"rungs of the DNA ladder\".\nThe bases are in different orders on different parts of the DNA strand. DNA is \"read\" by the order of the bases, that is by the order of the Ts, Cs, Gs, and As. The order of these bases is what is known as the DNA sequence. The DNA in almost all living things is made up of the same parts. What's different is the DNA sequence.\nGenetic inheritance is the process of passing down DNA from parents to children.\nYour genome is all of the DNA in your body.\nDNA is packaged into small units called chromosomes. A chromosome contains a single, long piece of DNA with many different genes. You inherit your chromosomes from your parents. Chromosomes come in pairs. Humans have 46 chromosomes, in 23 pairs. Children randomly get one of each pair of chromosomes from their mother and one of each pair from their father. There are 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes, called autosomes, and the chromosomes that form the 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes. They determine if a person is born a male or female. A female has two X chromosomes, and a male has one X and one Y chromosome. Each daughter gets an X from her mother and an X from her father. Each son gets an X from his mother and a Y from his father.\nEach chromosome has many genes. Genes are specific sections of DNA that have instructions for making proteins. Proteins make up most of the parts of your body and make your body work the right way.\nYou have two copies of every gene. You inherit one copy from your father and one copy from your mother. The genes people inherit from their parents can determine many things. For example, genes affect what a person will look like and whether the person might have certain diseases.\nAlleles are forms of the same gene that may have small differences in their sequence of DNA bases. These differences contribute to each person's unique features. Each person has two alleles for each gene, one from each parent. If the alleles of a gene are the same, the person is considered homozygous for the gene. If the alleles are different, the person is considered heterozygous for the gene.\nMost of the time, differences between alleles do not have much of an effect on the protein that is made. However, sometimes different alleles can result in differences in traits, such as blood type. Some alleles are associated with health problems or genetic disorders. In these alleles, the differences in the sequence of DNA bases affects the body's ability to make a certain protein.\nBecause your genes were passed down from your parents, you and your family members share many gene alleles. The more closely related you are, the more gene alleles you have in common.\nCells are the basic units of life. The human body contains trillions of cells. There are many different types of cells that make up the many different tissues and organs in the body. For example, skin cells, blood cells, heart cells, brain cells, and kidney cells are just a few of the cell types that perform different vital functions in the body.\nThe basic structure of a cell is a jelly-like substance known as cytoplasm, which is surrounded by a membrane to hold it together. Within the cytoplasm are various specialized structures that are important to the work of the cell. One of these structures is the cell nucleus, which contains the DNA packaged in chromosomes.\nGene expression refers to the process of making proteins using the instructions from genes. A person's DNA includes many genes that have instructions for making proteins. Additionally, certain sections of DNA are not part of a gene but are important in making sure the genes are working properly. These DNA sections provide directions about where in the body each protein should be made, when it should be made, and how much should be made.\nFor the most part, every cell in a person's body contains exactly the same DNA and genes, but inside individual cells some genes are active (\"turned on\") while others are not. Differences in how genes are used (expressed) to make proteins are why the different parts of your body look and work differently. For example, gene expression in the muscles is different from gene expression in the nerves.\nGene expression can change as you age. Also, your behaviors, such as smoking or exercise, or exposures in your environment can affect gene expression.\nDNA methylation works by adding a chemical (known as a methyl group) to DNA. This chemical can also be removed from the DNA through a process called demethylation. Typically, methylation turns genes \"off\" and demethylation turns genes \"on.\"\nDNA methylation is one of the ways the body controls gene expression. Methylation and demethylation do not change the DNA code (the sequence of the DNA bases), but they help determine how much protein is made.\nA genetic change (sometimes called a mutation, gene variant, or genetic variant) is a change in a DNA base sequence. While not all genetic changes will cause problems, sometimes, changes in genes can lead to changes in proteins and then the proteins don't work the way they are supposed to. This can lead to disease.\nSome genetic changes can be passed on from parent to child (inherited). These genetic changes occur in the germ cells, which are the cells that create sperm or eggs. Genetic changes that occur in the other cells in the body (known as somatic cells) do not get passed on to a person's children.\nGenetic changes happen when new cells are being made and the DNA is copied. Also, exposures, such as high levels of radiation, can damage the DNA and cause genetic changes. However, most exposures will not result in genetic changes because each cell in the body has a system in place to check for DNA damage and repair the damage once it's found.\nCopy number variation (CNV) refers to a feature of the genome, in which various sections of a person's DNA are repeated. While this happens in all people, the number of repeats (or copies) varies from one person to the next. CNVs play an important role in creating genetic diversity in humans. However, some CNVs are linked to diseases.\nEnvironmental factors include exposures related to where we live, such as air pollution; behaviors, such as smoking and exercise; and other health-related factors, such as the foods that we eat.\nEpigenetics refers to the ways a person's behaviors and the environment can cause changes that affect the way the genes work. Epigenetics turns genes \"on\" and \"off\" and thus is related to gene expression.\nEpigenetics change as people age, both as part of normal development and aging and because of exposure to environmental factors that happen over the course of a person's life. There are several different ways an environmental factor can cause an epigenetic change to occur. One of the most common ways is by causing changes to DNA methylation. DNA methylation works by adding a chemical (known as a methyl group) to DNA. This chemical can also be removed from the DNA through a process called demethylation. Typically, methylation turns genes \"off\" and demethylation turns genes \"on.\" Thus, environmental factors can impact the amount of protein a cell makes. Less protein might be made if an environmental factor causes an increase in DNA methylation, and more protein might be made if a factor causes an increase in demethylation."

VAERS accepts reports regardless of seriousness or how likely the vaccine may have caused the adverse event.\nA VAERS report alone does not indicate whether a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event. Only scientists and public health professionals can make this determination after thorough investigation.\nMost VAERS reports involve mild side effects such as fever, arm soreness or mild irritability. Federal law defines reports of certain adverse events as serious reports. These include reports of the following after vaccination:\nVAERS staff attempt to collect additional information from healthcare providers and clinicians about adverse events described in serious reports. While serious adverse events can happen after vaccination, they are rarely caused by the vaccine.\nOn May 8, 2025, CDC and FDA expanded public access to VAERS data in the WONDER database (wonder.cdc.gov) and in VAERS downloadable files (vaers.hhs.gov) to provide a more complete picture of all reported adverse events following vaccination received.

These conditions also contribute to the emergence of more dangerous forms of diseases, such as extensively drug-resistant typhoid fever. Addressing these challenges requires dedicated efforts to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices. These improvements are necessary for preventing the spread of disease and dealing with emerging threats like antibiotic-resistant infections.\nHarmful germs, parasites, or toxic chemicals can contaminate water. This contaminated water comes from human or animal waste, pesticides, and industrial waste. This can make people sick with diseases like cholera, typhoid, polio, and diarrhea. Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death in children under five years old. The primary risk factors for diarrhea include unsafe water and sanitation, along with childhood malnutrition.\nIn addition, not having access to clean water, toilets, and good hygiene practices makes it harder to stop and manage neglected tropical diseases likeschistosomiasis,trachoma, andGuinea worm disease. This keeps the cycle of poverty and sickness going. Having reliable access to safe water, proper sanitation, and good hygiene practices significantly reduces the burden of disease globally.\nKey facts highlight the impact of these conditions:\nImproving WASH infrastructure and practices is key to breaking the cycle of disease and poverty and highlights the need for global efforts to ensure everyone has access to safe water and sanitation."

The study was supposed to observe the natural history of untreated syphilis. As part of the study, researchers did not collect informed consent from participants. They also did not offer treatment, even after it was easily available. Thestudy endedin 1972 on the recommendation of an Ad Hoc Advisory Panel. The panel was convened by the Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs, following publication of news articles about the study.\nIn 1997, President Clinton issued aformal Presidential Apology. In his apology he announced an investment to establish what becameThe National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care at Tuskegee University. Many records can be found inthe National Archives.\nAfter the study, sweeping changes to standard research practices were made. Efforts to promote the highest ethical standards in research are ongoing today."

Proper seat belt fit usually occurs when children are age 9\u201312.\nSEAT BELT\nWhen seat belt fits properly without a booster seat\nChildren no longer need to use a booster seat when the seat belt fits them properly. A seat belt fits properly when the lap belt is across the upper thighs (not the stomach) and the shoulder belt is across the center of the shoulder and chest (not across the neck or face, and not off the shoulder).\nKeep children properly buckled in the back seat until age 13.\n*Recommended age ranges for each seat type vary to account for differences in child growth and weight/height limits of car seats and booster seats. Use the car seat or booster seat manual to check for important information about installation, the seat weight and height limits, and proper seat use.\nChild passenger safety recommendations: American Academy of Pediatrics 2018.\nwww.cdc.gov/child-passenger-safety/about\nCDC.

People are exposed to lead by eating lead paint chips, ingesting contaminated food or water, and/or by breathing in lead dust.\nChildren younger than 6 years are more likely to be exposed due to their hand-to-mouth behavior. Many children ingest lead dust by putting objects such as toys and dirt in their mouths.\nNo safe blood lead level (BLL) in children has been identified. Even low levels of lead in blood are associated with developmental delays, difficulty learning, and behavioral issues. Theeffectsof lead poisoning can be permanent and disabling.\nThere are steps that parents and healthcare providers can take toprotect children from lead exposure. Healthcare providers can perform a blood lead test if a child was or may have been exposed to lead.\nCDC uses ablood lead reference value(BLRV) of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter (\u00b5g/dL). This reference level helps identify children with BLLs higher than most children's levels. CDC estimates that approximately 500,000 children in the United States have BLLs at or above the BLRV. Healthcare providers can use CDC'sRecommended Actions Based on Blood Lead Levelto develop a plan of action for their patient.

These diseases have many causes, symptoms, and treatments and can affect people of all ages and races.\nWhen cardiomyopathy occurs, the normal muscle in the heart can thicken, stiffen, thin out, or fill with substances the body produces that do not belong in the heart muscle. As a result, the heart muscle's ability to pump blood is reduced. This, in turn, can lead to irregular heartbeats, the backup of blood into the lungs or rest of the body, and heart failure.\nCardiomyopathy can be acquired\u2014developed because of another disease, condition, or factor\u2014or inherited. The cause isn't always known.\nThe main types of cardiomyopathy include the following:1234\nDilated:meaning that one of the pumping chambers (ventricles) of the heart is enlarged. This is more common in males and is the most common form of cardiomyopathy in children. It can occur at any age and may or may not be inherited.\nHypertrophic:where the heart muscle is thickened. This often presents in childhood or early adulthood and can cause sudden death in adolescents and young adult athletes.1It is often an inherited condition, and a person may not have any symptoms. If there is a family history of this, other family members can be tested and adjust their activities to reduce the risk of sudden death.\nArrhythmogenic:where the disease causes irregular heartbeats or rhythms. This is often inherited and more common in males.\nRestrictive:where heart muscle is stiff or scarred, or both. It can occur with amyloidosis (a rare disease that occurs when a protein called amyloid builds up in organs), or hemochromatosis (a disorder in which extra iron builds up in the body to harmful levels), and other conditions. This is the least common type.\nCardiomyopathy often goes undiagnosed,5so the numbers can vary. As many as 1 of 500 adults may have this condition.67Males and females of all ages and races can have cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is more common in Black people than in White people, and in males than in females.5\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to be the most common inherited or genetic heart disease. While this type of cardiomyopathy occurs at many ages, in children and young adults with this condition there may be no symptoms. Yet they are at high risk of sudden cardiac death."

Pediatric cardiomyopathy can be inherited or acquired through a viral infection, and sometimes the cause is unknown. It is a frequent cause of sudden cardiac arrest in the young, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Treatment may include medications, changes to physical activity, or surgery.\nIn many cases, early detection and intervention can help to improve outcomes for children.\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare form of heart failure that can occur near the end of pregnancy or up to a year after giving birth. The heart muscle becomes weak, causing a buildup of fluid in the lungs.\nSymptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swollen ankles or legs. Because these symptoms can also occur in a normal pregnancy, recognition and treatment for this condition can be delayed.\nWomen who are pregnant or who have recently delivered a baby should seek medical care immediately if they are experiencing anyurgent maternal warning signs. These symptoms could indicate a life-threatening situation.\nTreatment may include close monitoring by the woman's health care team and prescription medication.\nMany medicines may be safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, including diuretics, beta-blockers, or blood thinners.8\nThe risk of PPCM is higher for Black women and for women who are older than 30, who are pregnant with more than one fetus, or who have a history of preeclampsia or chronic high blood pressure.9"

Water contaminated with germs, chemicals, or toxins can lead to waterborne illness if you drink it, breathe it in, or it touches your skin, eyes, ears, or other mucous membranes. By collecting data on the types of water, water systems, settings, and agents (what spreads the disease) that are linked to waterborne illness, we improve our understanding of waterborne illnesses and can better guide prevention efforts.\nOutbreak investigations help us learn more about the causes of outbreaks. Officials can learn what germs are causing waterborne illness, what types of water are involved, and what groups of people become ill. This knowledge can be used to control an outbreak and prevent additional illnesses. Outbreak surveillance enables public health agencies to learn lessons from these investigations to develop recommendations on how to prevent similar outbreaks from happening in the future.\nMany of the germs that are spread by water can also be spread in other ways, including by eating contaminated food or by contact with an ill person or animal. People come in contact with water often each day, making it even harder to know which exposure might have made a person sick. Finally, it can take several days or even weeks to become ill after being exposed to a germ, making it difficult to pinpoint the place and time of exposure.Without an outbreak investigation, it can be difficult or impossible to link illnesses to water.\nWhen a group of people become ill at the same time, an investigation that collects information on timing and location of exposures and illnesses (known as an epidemiologic investigation) can help determine where and when the outbreak started and what caused it. An outbreak investigation can sometimes identify a direct link between the illnesses and contaminated water and might identify the type of water, systems, or settings involved. This information is difficult to gather outside of an outbreak (such as with individual infections)."

At least one in seven children experienced child abuse or neglect in the past year in the United States.2This is likely an underestimate because many cases are unreported. In 2021, 1,820 children died of abuse and neglect in the United States.3\nChildren living in poverty experience more abuse and neglect. Experiencing poverty can place a lot of stress on families, which may increase the risk for child abuse and neglect. Rates of child abuse and neglect are five times higher for children in families with low socioeconomic status compared to families with a higher socioeconomic status.\nChild maltreatment is costly. In the United States, the total lifetime economic burden associated with child abuse and neglect was about $592 billion in 2018.4This economic burden rivals the cost of other high-profile public health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes.5"

Getting sick fromCronobacterdoes not happen often, but infections in infants can be deadly. Infants less than 2 months old are most likely to develop meningitis (an inflammation of the membranes that protect the brain and spine) if they are infected withCronobacterbacteria. Infants born prematurely and those with weakened immune systems are also at risk for severe illness.Cronobacterinfections in infants less than 12 months old are often linked to powdered infant formula.

CDC typically receives reports of about 2 to 4 infections in infants per year, but Minnesota and Michigan were the only states that required reporting. Because most states did not require reporting, rates ofCronobacterinfection in the United States are not well understood. However, aliterature review from 1961 to 2018provides evidence thatCronobacterinfections are most common in infants less than 2 months old and often cause death in this age group. Also, infections among older adults may be more common, although milder, than infections among infants.\nThe true number of annual cases is unknown. However, invasiveCronobacterinfections among infants have been added to the list of nationally notifiable conditions in 2024, requiring health providers to report diagnosed cases to state or local public health officials. This will help us learn more about the true number of cases that occur each year. Typically, CDC receives 2-4 reports of severeCronobacterinfections in infants annually from health departments and has received reports from 32 states. From January 2002 to July 2022, CDC received 76 reports of severeCronobacterillnesses among infants. A recent report estimates that approximately 20% of infants with meningitis or bloodstream infections due toCronobacterin the United States have died (Strysko, 2020). Worldwide, approximately 40% of infants reported to haveCronobactermeningitis or bloodstream infections have died (Strysko, 2020)."

UVA is the most abundant source of solar radiation at the earth's surface. UVA penetrates beyond the top layer of human skin. Scientists believe that UVA radiation can cause damage to connective tissue and increase a person's risk for developing skin cancer. UVB rays penetrate less deeply into skin but can still cause some forms of skin cancer. Natural UVC rays do not pose a risk to workers because they are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.\nSunlight exposure is highest during the summer and between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Working outdoors during these times increases the chances of getting sunburned.\nSnow and light-colored sand reflect UV light and increase the risk of sunburn.

LLS is a service-learning, multidimensional program that encompasses the competencies of applied public health laboratory research, laboratory operations and quality management, the science of biosafety, bioinformatics, advanced communications, and leadership training. The program guides fellows through 10 core activities of learning to help build skill sets in these competency areas deemed critical for success as a laboratory leader. LLS fellows hone their leadership skills and create a culture of scientific excellence in laboratory science by emphasizing high standards in areas such as laboratory quality, safety, and service to protect the public\u2019s health, safety, and security.\nLLS is closely aligned with CDC\u2019sEpidemic Intelligence Service(EIS) to promote interdisciplinary training, applied learning, and collaboration between laboratory scientists and epidemiologists. LLS provides opportunities for fellows to serve public health agencies and learn through field experiences and domestic or international emergency responses."

People with FH have increased blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, sometimes called \"bad cholesterol.\" Having too much LDL cholesterol in your blood increases your risk for developing coronary artery disease or having aheart attack. For people with FH, exercising and healthy eating habits are important, but often not enough to lower their cholesterol to a healthy level. Medicines, such as statins, are needed to help control cholesterol levels. If you have FH, finding the disorder early and treating it can reduce your risk of coronary artery disease by about 80%. If your child is diagnosed with FH, statin therapy in childhood may be required, often starting by age 8-10."

        "heading": "Signs and symptoms",
        "content": "One of the main signs of FH is LDL cholesterol levels over 190 mg/dL in adults (and over 160 mg/dL in children). In addition, most people with FH have afamily health historyof early coronary artery disease or heart attacks. In some cases, elevated LDL levels are found through routine blood cholesterol screening. If you have a family health history of heart disease or FH and have not had your cholesterol screened, your healthcare provider may order lipid screening, which measures the amount of cholesterol and lipids (fats) in your blood.\nYour healthcare provider may be able to detect physical signs of FH during a clinical exam, although not everyone with FH has these signs. These physical signs of FH occur when extra cholesterol builds up in different parts of the body:\nIf your healthcare provider suspects you have FH, he or she may refer you forgenetic counselingandtesting for FH."

        "heading": "Causes",
        "content": "FH is mainly caused by inherited genetic changes (mutations) in theLDLR,APOB, andPCSK9genes, which affect how your body regulates and removes cholesterol from your blood. About 60-80% of people with FH have a genetic change found in one of these genes.Genetic testingis available to check for these and other rarer genetic changes. However, there are likely more genes involved in FH that remain unknown.\nYou have two copies of each of the genes involved in FH, one from your mother and one from your father. A genetic change in only one copy of theLDLR,APOB, orPCSK9genes is enough to cause FH. If either your mother or father has a genetic change in one of these genes that causes FH, they have a 50% chance of passing it on to you.\nMost people with FH only have one FH-causing genetic change. In very rare cases, a person can have two FH-causing changes in both copies of the same gene, which results in a much more serious, rare form of FH called homozygous FH. There are two forms of homozygous FH:\nPeople with homozygous FH have extremely high levels of cholesterol and can have heart attacks in childhood. People with homozygous FH need to find a healthcare provider knowledgeable about FH andstart treatmentright away."

Without the right treatment, your infection will move to the latent and possibly tertiary stages of syphilis.\nThe latent stage of syphilis is a period when there are no visible signs or symptoms. Without treatment, you can continue to have syphilis in your body for years.\nMost people with untreated syphilis do not develop tertiary syphilis. However, when it does happen, it can affect many different organ systems. These include the heart and blood vessels, and the brain and nervous system. Tertiary syphilis is very serious and would occur 10\u201330 years after your infection began. In tertiary syphilis, the disease damages your internal organs and can result in death. A healthcare provider can usually diagnose tertiary syphilis with the help of multiple tests.\nWithout treatment, syphilis can spread to the brain and nervous system (neurosyphilis), the eye (ocular syphilis), or the ear (otosyphilis).

If that is not possible, use sterile injection equipment for each injection to reduce the risk of infection and prevent outbreaks.\nSSPs are associated with an estimated 50% reduction in HIV and HCV infections.

Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.\nWash any riot control agents from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.\nIf your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.\nIf you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).\nIf you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.\nAfter you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.\nAnything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.\nSeal or tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.\nWhen the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes.

This allows health departments to leverage health information systems to inform response activities.\nReceiving timely, accurate, complete, and consistent laboratory report data can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public health responses to outbreaks and cases of state reportable conditions. Using standardized formats promotes interoperability and improves exchange, integration, sharing and retrieval of data. Data improvements\u202finclude:\nAs early as 2005, CDC, in partnership with theAssociation of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), began paving the way for what is now the COVID-19 Electronic Laboratory Reporting (CELR) program. In 2009, APHL created a secure, cloud-based platform to help state health departments, state laboratories, regional commercial laboratories, and federal agencies report their data. State health departments have increasingly used this platform, supported by ongoing financial and technical support from CDC, to increase the reportable disease results shared with CDC.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic necessitated timely access and dissemination of de-identified electronic healthcare data to guide the domestic response. Previous investments CDC made into reporting systems infrastructure allowed the CELR program to quickly enable detailed data reporting from public health departments to CDC for approximately 90 percent of the COVID-19 testing volume conducted nationwide. This robust dataset informs public health decision-making to help reduce disease in communities."

Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from arsine.\nIf arsine was released outside, move away from the area.\nIf arsine was released indoors, get out of the building.\nIf you are near an arsine release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or \"shelter in place\" inside.\nFor more information on evacuation during a chemical emergency, visit \"Responding to Evacuation.\"\nFor more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, visit \"Responding to Sheltering in Place.\"\nRemove the clothing as quickly as possible.\nCut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head.\nIf you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.\nWash any arsine from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.\nIf your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.\nIf you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).\nIf you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.\nAfter you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do not touch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you have to touch unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.\nAnything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.\nTie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.\nWhen the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.\nFor more information about cleaning your body and throwing away your clothes after a chemical exposure, visit \"About Getting Clean.\""

Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps, or rubella.\nMMR vaccine has been linked with a very small risk offebrile seizures. Febrile seizures following MMR vaccination are rare and are not associated with any long-term effects. Because the risk of febrile seizures increases as infants get older, it is recommended that they get vaccinated as soon as recommended.\nExtremely rarely, a person may have a serious allergic reaction to MMR vaccine. Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine."

Vaccine safety experts, including experts at CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), agree that MMR vaccine is not responsible for recent increases in the number of children with autism. In 2004, a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded that there is no link between autism and MMR vaccine, and that there is no link between autism and vaccines that contain thimerosal as a preservative."

The Privacy Rule protects all PHI transmitted or maintained in any form or medium (e.g. electronic, paper, or oral) by a covered entity or its business associates. It excludes certain educational and employment records.\nThe Privacy Rule gives individuals certain rights in respect to their health information including, but not limited to, the right to inspect and request corrections or amendments to their PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of their privacy rights and how their PHI will be used and disclosed.\nThe Privacy Rule generally prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI without the written authorization from the individual; however, there are several exceptions to this requirement includingdisclosuresfor public health activities.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. \u00a71232g;34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.

The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.\nFERPA gives parents certain rights regarding their child's education record. These rights include the right to inspect and request corrections to the record. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level.\nFERPA generally prohibits the disclosure of any personally identifiable information contained in an education record without the appropriate written consent.

        "heading": "Background",
        "content": "Soman, also known as \"GD,\" is a human-made chemical warfare agent that is a type of nerve agent. It was originally developed as an insecticide (insect killer) in Germany in 1944.\nNerve agents are the most toxic (harmful) and fast acting of the known chemical warfare agents.\nNerve agents are similar to pesticides (insect killers) called organophosphates. They are similar in terms of how they work and the kinds of harmful effects they cause. However, nerve agents are much stronger than organophosphate pesticides.\nSoman is a clear, colorless, tasteless liquid with a slight smell similar to camphor containing mothballs or rotten fruit. It can become a vapor (gas) if heated."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Where it is found",
        "content": "Soman is not found naturally in the environment.\nIt is possible that soman or other nerve agents were used in chemical warfare during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s."
      },
      {
        "heading": "How it works",
        "content": "All the nerve agents cause their toxic effects by preventing enzymes from working. Enzymes act as the body's \"off switch\" for glands and muscles. Without an \"off switch,\" the glands and muscles are constantly being stimulated (worked). They may get tired and no longer be able to keep working on things such as breathing.\nCompared with other nerve agents, soman is more volatile thanVX(the strongest nerve agent) but less volatile than sarin. Higher volatility means it is more likely to evaporate from a liquid into a gas and spread into the environment.\nBecause soman is more volatile than VX, it will stay on surfaces for a shorter period of time compared with VX.\nPeople can be exposed to the gas even if they do not come in contact with the liquid form.\nBecause of its high volatility, soman is an immediate but short-lived threat. Soman does not last a long time in the environment."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Signs and symptoms",
        "content": "The level of soman poisoning depends on the amount of soman, how the person was exposed, and for how long.\nSymptoms will likely appear within a few seconds after exposure to the vapor (gas) form of soman. Symptoms will likely appear within a few minutes to hours after exposure to the liquid form.\nPeople can be exposed to soman by breathing it in, swallowing, or through skin absorption. Exposure to a low or medium amount can cause some or all of the following symptoms within seconds to hours:\nEven a tiny drop of nerve agent on the skin can cause sweating and muscle twitching where the agent touched.\nExposure to a large amount of soman in any way can cause these additional negative health effects:\nShowing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to soman."

However, the smell may not be noticeable or strong enough to give people enough of a warning.\nIf soman is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact or by breathing it in. Because soman vapor (gas) is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase chances of exposure there.\nSoman mixes easily with water, so it could be used to poison water. If soman is in the water, people can be exposed by drinking the water or getting the water on their skin.\nIf soman is in food, people can be exposed by eating the food. A person's clothes can also release soman if it touched soman gas, which can expose other people."

        "content": "Recovery from soman exposure is possible with treatment, but the antidotes (cure) must be used quickly (within minutes) to be effective. Therefore, the best thing to do is avoid exposure\nGet fresh air by leaving the area where the soman was released. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the chances of death from soman.\nIf the soman was released outdoors, move away from the area where the soman was released. Go to the highest ground possible, because soman is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas. If soman was released indoors, get out of the building.\nIf you swallowed soman, do not force vomiting or drink fluids. Get medical attention right away.\nIf you think you were exposed, take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible.\nRemove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, avoid touching unsafe areas.\nPut your clothing inside a plastic bag. Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.\nWhen the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.\nWash any soman from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.\nIf your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes."

While the parasite\u2019s preferred host is the specific bird or mammal, if the parasite comes into contact with a swimmer, it burrows into the skin causing an allergic reaction and rash. Swimmer\u2019s itch is found throughout the world and is more frequent during summer months."

Also, they are less likely to towel dry themselves when leaving the water.\nMany factors must be present for swimmer\u2019s itch to become a problem in water. Since these factors change (sometimes within a swim season), swimmer\u2019s itch will not always be a problem. However, there is no way to know how long water may be unsafe. Larvae generally survive for 24 hours once they are released from the snail. However, an infected snail will continue to produce cercariae throughout the remainder of its life. For future snails to become infected, migratory birds or mammals in the area must also be infected so the lifecycle can continue.\nAs long as your swimming pool is well maintained and chlorinated, there is no risk of swimmer\u2019s itch. The appropriate snails must be present in order for swimmer\u2019s itch to occur."

The parasites produce eggs that are passed in the feces of infected birds or mammals.\nIf the eggs land in or are washed into the water, the eggs hatch, releasing small, free-swimming microscopic larvae. These larvae swim in the water in search of a certain species of aquatic snail.\nIf the larvae find one of these snails, they infect the snail, multiply and undergo further development. Infected snails release a different type of microscopic larvae (or cercariae, hence the name cercarial dermatitis) into the water. This larval form then swims about searching for a suitable host (bird, muskrat) to continue the lifecycle. Although humans are not suitable hosts, the microscopic larvae burrow into the swimmer\u2019s skin, and may cause an allergic reaction and rash. Because these larvae cannot develop inside a human, they soon die."

It's not known what animal carries ebolaviruses in nature but scientists suspect that bats are likely involved. Once filoviruses are introduced into the human population, they can spread between people through contact with an infected person's body fluids. Caretakers and healthcare providers who do not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) are at higher risk of infection.\nFlaviviruses, are found throughout the world. These viruses, which are primarily spread by mosquitoes and ticks, can cause mild to severe disease or even death. They can also cause disease in animals, creating a large economic and social impact on people living in affected areas.\nParamyxoviruses can cause sudden onset of respiratory disease. While there are many viruses included within theParamyxoviridaefamily, Hendra and Nipah viruses are considered more serious because they require a specialized lab (biosafety level 4 lab) and can cause serious disease, spread between animals and people , and have no vaccine or treatment currently available.\nLikely bats, (species unknown)"

However, any commercial sexual activity with a minor, even without force, fraud, or coercion, is considered trafficking.\nThis type of violence exploits women, men, and children across the United States and around the world. Trafficking victimization and perpetration share risks and consequences associated withchild abuse and neglect,intimate partner violence,sexual violence, andyouth violence."

Victims can come from all backgrounds and become trapped in different locations and situations.\nMany victims are women and girls, though men and boys are also impacted. Victims include all races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, citizens, non-citizens, and income levels. Victims are trapped and controlled through assault, threats, false promises, perceived sense of protection, isolation, shaming, and debt. Victims do not have to be physically transported between locations to be victimized.\nThe consequences of sex trafficking are similar to the consequences of sexual violence. Consequences can be immediate and long-term including physical and relationship problems, psychological concerns, and negative chronic health outcomes.

Food irradiation is considered a \"cold\" method, meaning it does not use heat to kill germs. Other food safety processes that you may be more familiar with, like pasteurization and canning, use heat.\nThe irradiation process happens after a food is produced and packaged. Food enters a chamber where it is exposed to a specific amount of radiation. The radiation penetrates the food and kills germs or prevents them from multiplying, and it does not linger in the food. Irradiation is one more protective step, but it does not replace other food safety measures."

After you receive an X-ray, you are not radioactive, and no additional radiation or radioactive materials remain inside or outside your body.

Showering is the best method for removing phosgene from your body.\nIdeally, undress, blot, and shower immediately or as soon as you can, as described below. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.\nIf clothes are frozen to your body, do not try to remove until no longer frozen. Instead, begin washing with a lot of lukewarm water. Then remove your clothes.\nAvoid pulling clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the phosgene from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Drop clothes to the floor.\nIf you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.\nFollow these steps to blot your body:\nRepeat the process several times if you still feel liquid on you. Use a different clean cloth or towel for each part of your body. Use a different clean cloth or towel each time you repeat the process.\nFirst wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with a lot of lukewarm water and mild soap (if available) for 90 seconds. Use soapy water for a minute, then rinse with plain water for 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub!\nIf your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10 to 15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops.\nDry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.\nIf emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.\nOtherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.\nDo not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch phosgene. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up."

Several types of mosquitoes are capable of transmittingDirofilariainfection, includingAedes,Anopheles, andMansonia.\nHumans and a wide range of other mammals are accidental hosts that play no role in the transmission ofDirofilaria.

This can result in people using alternative sources of fuel or electricity for heating, cooling, or cooking. These sources can lead to elevated CO levels in enclosed spaces, poisoning people and animals inside.\nCDC usesNPDSfor surveillance during disaster response and recovery efforts to track reported exposures to CO. Using these data can help inform public health messaging to prevent further injury and death.\nIn April 2020, CDC published areportthat described an increase in calls to poison centers about exposures to cleaners and disinfectants. Using data from NPDS, CDC and America's Poison Centers found that poison centers nationwide received 45,550 calls regarding exposures to cleaners and disinfectants during the first three months of 2020-an increase of about 20% from the same timeframe in 2019. The timing of these reported exposures corresponded to increased media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of consumer shortages of cleaning and disinfection products, and the beginning of some local and state stay-at-home orders.\nThe results of this study highlighted the importance of safe and appropriate use of cleaners and disinfectants to prevent potential poisonings and injuries.\nHarmful algal blooms(HABs) are the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria that can cause harm to people, animals, and the environment. In 2019, CDC and America\u2019s Poison Centers worked with five poison centers to conduct follow-up surveys with people who had called regarding a HAB exposure. Fifty-five people were interviewed. Most callers (65%) stated they were exposed through multiple routes with the most common being skin contact (84%) and ingestion (60%). The most frequently reported source of exposure was bathing or swimming in contaminated water. Few callers had heard or read warnings about the dangers of HABs before or during their exposure.\nThis study highlights the importance of characterizing exposures to HABs to tailor public health messaging.\nCDC launched an investigation in April 2015 after being alerted to an increase in poison center calls related to synthetic cannabinoids, also known as synthetic marijuana. The results,published in MMWR, led to a surge in media coverage on this issue that created a broader awareness of issues and dangers of using synthetic cannabinoids.\nElectronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are devices that heat a liquid mixture to allow users to inhale an aerosol that typically contains nicotine, flavorings, and other additives. While long-term impacts of these products on public health are unknown, one area of concern is the potential for poisonings. A CDCstudyfound that 2,405 e-cigarette exposures were reported to poison centers from September 2010 to February 2014.\nThis work informed public health actions including the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015, enacted in January 2016. This law requires any container of liquid nicotine that is sold, manufactured, distributed, or imported into the United States use packaging that is difficult for children under 5 years of age to open.\nFrom May 17\u2013June 17, 2012, poison centers across the countryreported485 cases of children being exposed to detergent-filled laundry pods. CDC partnered with America's Poison Centers and poison centers in Charlotte and Philadelphia to investigate this public health threat. Their work helped contribute to the decision by the largest manufacturer of laundry detergent pods in the United States to add a double latch lid safety feature to their containers. Manufacturers have also worked with poison centers to study risk factors and health outcomes linked to laundry detergent pod exposures.\nCDC tracked all calls to poison centers related to the 2011 Japan nuclear event. Between March 11 and April 18, NPDS tracked 340 information requests and 64 calls regarding potential radiation, potassium iodide and iodide product exposures. Call details were analyzed daily for situational awareness and to inform public health response efforts. Staff from CDC and America\u2019s Poison Centers performed detailed follow up and data review to confirm exposure status. Surveillance for calls related to potassium iodide (a medication used to prevent the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid) exposures documented adverse outcomes in persons taking this product in response to a perceived risk from this event.\nDuring 2010, 1838 calls were received by 57 poison centers related to the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill. Of these, 1,160 were self-reported exposures and symptoms, including cough, nausea, headache, eye irritation, throat irritation, chest pain, dizziness, difficulty breathing, and rash. The data were used to identify trends and monitor severity of health effects. This information helped public health officials determine the impact of the oil spill on health. Information was also shared with states to aid in their public health response."

VSD uses computerized data from managed care organizations, which gather data on vaccination, demographic information, and health outcomes of their patients (more than 8.8 million patients across the country each year).\nAs part of ongoing efforts to monitor the safety of vaccines, CDC used rapid cycle analysis to study the safety of the MMRV vaccine.\nOnly children aged 12-23 months who received the first dose were studied. This information was presented at the June 2009 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting.\nBecause these studies showed an increased risk for fever after MMRV vaccination, compared with vaccination with MMR and varicella vaccines in separate shots at the same visit, there was concern about a potential increased risk for febrile seizures (seizures triggered by a rising or dropping fever) after MMRV vaccination. As part of routine monitoring of vaccine safety for all new vaccines, CDC conducted studies of the safety of MMRV vaccine. In these studies, CDC analyzed data reported to theVSDregarding MMRV vaccine given to children aged 12-23 months, the age when the first dose of MMRV or MMR and varicella vaccines is recommended. The study assessed the rate of several medical events after MMRV vaccination, including febrile seizures.\nMerck, the manufacturer of the MMRV vaccine, also sponsored an observational study (after MMRV vaccine was licensed) of febrile seizures after the first dose of MMRV vaccine was given to children aged 12-23 months. Here are some key findings from that study:\nThese findings and other relevant data were presented to theAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). In May 2010, CDC releasednew recommendationson the use of MMRV vaccine.\nTo help parents and healthcare providers better understand the ACIP recommendations, risks and benefits of MMRV vaccine, and febrile seizures, the following information is available:\nThe study, \"Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella Combination Vaccine and the Risk of Febrile Seizures\" uses computerized information from CDC'sVaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Project. VSD consists of managed care organizations which gather vaccination and demographic information, as well as health outcomes of their patients (more than 9.2 million across the U.S.)\nResearchers examined VSD data on more than 83,000 children who received their first dose of MMRV vaccine and over 376,000 children who received their first doses of MMR and varicella vaccines given at the same visit from the year 2000 to the year 2008.\nCDC recommends providers who choose to use the combination MMRV vaccine be aware of and clearly communicate to parents and caregivers the increased risk of fever and seizure within the 7 to 10 days following vaccination.\nParents should be educated on the risk of seizure following the combination MMRV vaccine and know their options. Most children recover quickly from febrile seizures and have no lasting effects."

Because public health actions are often undertaken by governments and are directed at the population level, the principles and values which guide public health can differ from those which guide actions in biology and clinical medicine (bioethics and medical ethics) which are more patient or individual-centered.\nAs a field of practice, public health ethics is the application of relevant principles and values to public health decision making. In applying an ethics framework, public health ethics inquiry carries out three core functions, namely:\nThe CDC Office of Science supports CDC's public health ethics capacity to foster an environment and culture that:"

They can appear up to 21 days after the contact. By that time, the bite or scratch should be healed. This might make it hard to remember you were bitten.\nWithin 2 to 4 days after the fever begins, a rash may appear on the hands and feet. This rash looks like flat, reddened areas with small bumps. One or more joints may then become swollen, red, or painful.\nThe bacteria that cause RBF in Asia can be different than the bacteria that causes RBF in North America. If you were infected by contact with rodents in Asia, your symptoms might be different. They can include fever, swelling around the bite if you have one, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. As with the type of RBF found in North America, getting early treatment is important to protecting your health.\nComplications of RBF can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly.

Parkinson-like symptoms may include tremors, slowness of movement, muscle rigidity, and poor balance.\nNeurological and Neurobehavioral Effects\nNumerous studies indicate that welders may be at increased risk of neurological and neurobehavioral health effects when exposed to metals such as lead, iron, and manganese. Carbon monoxide, heat, and stress can also contribute to neurological impairments in welders. Some studies indicate that welders exposed to low levels of manganese (<0.2 mg/m3) perform more poorly on tests of brain function and motor skills. These effects include changes in mood and short-term memory, altered reaction time, and reduced hand-eye coordination. Affected workers frequently show abnormal accumulations of manganese in the region of the brain known as the globus pallidus, which plays an important role in movement regulation.\nWelder's Anthrax\nNIOSH researchers identified a new occupational disease among metalworkers calledwelder's anthrax. It is a rare but serious disease caused by the bacteria that produces anthrax toxin. Research suggests that exposure to metal fumes might increase workers' risk for lung infection. This is true even with common, relatively harmless infectious agents. It is still mostly unknown how metal fumes cause this disease. Theories include that metal fumes (or iron) act as a growth nutrient for bacteria, enhance the binding of bacteria to lung tissues, or impair immune responses in the lung through oxidative stress."

For example, exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer.\nThe definition of a cancer cluster can be further explained as follows:\nA greater than expected number\nWhen the number of observed cases is greater than typically observed in a similar setting.\nOf the same or etiologically related cancer cases\nCases are of the same type, are within a family of tumors (for exampleEwing's family of tumors) or have a known or suggested link to the same specific environmental or chemical exposures. It is possible to consider multiple cancer types when such a known exposure (for example, radiation or a specific chemical) is linked to more than one cancer type or when more than one contaminant or exposure type has been identified.\nWithin a group of people\nThe population in which the cancer cases are occurring is defined by its demographic factors (for example, race/ethnicity, age, and sex).\nIn a geographic area\nThe geographic area may be based upon pre-existing geopolitical boundaries (for example, census tract, county, or ZIP code/ZIP code tabulation area). It may be defined according to the nature and extent of potential exposures that may cross multiple or partial boundaries. For example, air pollution from a hazardous waste incinerator which may cross multiple counties or census tracts. These geographic boundaries are used to determine the number of cancer cases as they relate to the total population in this predefined area. It is possible to create or obscure a cluster inadvertently by modifying the area of interest.\nOver a defined period of time\nThe time frame used to establish the beginning and end dates for analysis. The time period chosen for analysis will affect both the total cases observed and the calculation of the expected incidence of cancer in the population.\nNot every unusual pattern of cancer will meet the above definition of a cancer cluster.

Before talking to family members about their risk of having the same genetic change, it could be helpful to anticipate possible reactions. For example, if you think that a family member might get emotional from learning this information, it might be best to tell them about this in a comfortable, private area.\nIf a family member refuses to talk about this information, it is important to respect their decision. Some people do not want to know about their risks for developing certain diseases because it will cause them too much anxiety. However, you can offer them other options, so they can get the information on their own terms. For example, you can provide them information on how to talk to a genetic counselor or give them a letter that they can open whenever they are ready. Sample letters are available forhereditary breast and ovarian cancer,Lynch syndrome, andfamilial hypercholesterolemia.\nThe process of talking to children about hereditary conditions may differ from talking to adult family members. Your children\u2019s immediate concern might be how the condition will affect your health and the impact that will have on them. Your child\u2019s age may affect how you talk to them about your condition and their chances of having it. For younger children, it may be helpful to tell them smaller pieces of information over time to allow them time to process the information you share. Older children may want to learn all the information in one conversation, and then want to talk to a medical provider about their own health risks. A genetic counselor can help you plan how to tell your children about your condition and their risks, and provide information on when your children should get genetic testing."

The Analytics and Modeling Track is intended for disease modelers, ecologists, operations researchers, industrial engineers, and applied mathematicians.\nSince 1995, CDC has recruited and trained effective decision scientists through the fellowship. With each new class, the PE Fellowship builds a cadre of scientists whose research provides vital information to decision makers. CDC, congress, and nongovernmental agencies use information on resource allocation to maximize the impact of public health programs.\nPrevention effectiveness uses econometrics, decision science, simulation, operations analysis and modeling. The purpose is to understand determinants of health; morbidity and mortality; health inequalities and disparities; the cost of public health services and preventive interventions; the burden of illnesses; impact of regulations on population health; and ways to optimize resources for public health."

More than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur in the United States each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result. Many more die from complications from antimicrobial-resistant infections.\nImproving how healthcare professionals prescribe and how patients take antibiotics can help keep patients healthy from adverse events, combat antimicrobial resistance, and help ensure these life-saving drugs will be available for future generations.\nEach year during USAAW, CDC works collaboratively with federal, domestic, and international partners to raise awareness of the threat of antimicrobial resistance and highlight the critical importance of appropriate antibiotic and antifungal use.

Adult female head lice are usually larger than males and can lay about six eggs each day.

Nits take about a week (range 6 \u2013 9 days) to hatch into nymphs (young lice). Nymphs look similar to adult lice but are very small (size of a pinhead); they take about seven days to mature into adult lice.\nThe most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who already has head lice. This contact can be common among children playing at places like school or the home. Getting head lice is not related to cleanliness of you or your environment.\nAlthough not as common, head lice may spread by:\nContracting lice from a wig or hairpiece is extremely unlikely.

A fine-toothed louse comb may help you find lice.\nIf you do not see crawling lice, look for nits attached firmly within \u00bc inch of the base of hair shafts. You will often see nits on hair behind the ears and near the back of the neck. Nits that are attached more than \u00bc inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always hatched or dead.\nAlthough head lice and nits can be visible with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice or nits. Nits are often confused with other particles found in hair such as dandruff, hair spray droplets, and dirt particles.\nIf you do not see nymphs or adults, and the only nits found are more than \u00bc inch from the scalp, then the infestation is probably old and does not need treatment."

There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant). More than 122 million Americans are living with diabetes (37.3 million) or prediabetes (96 million). People with diabetes (type 1, type 2, or gestational), even when well-managed, are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. These complications can result in hospitalization and sometimes even death.Flu-related complicationsinclude pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and ear infections. About 30% of adults hospitalized with flu reported to the CDC had diabetes in recent seasons. Acute illnesses like the flu can make controlling blood sugar levels harder. The flu may raise blood sugar levels. For example, a reduced appetite when sick can cause blood sugar levels to fall. People with diabetes need to follow thesick day guidelinesif they become ill."

These types of cases occur when prion proteins already in the body misfold for some unknown reason. The result is disease that breaks down the brain's functions. Some cases are fatal within a few months of the first symptoms, and most are fatal within a year.\nAbout 5-15 percent of CJD cases occur because the person has inherited a mutation in the prion protein gene. A person with CJD with a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) who also has the disease would have familial CJD.\nIatrogenic cases are caused by contact with prions in a healthcare setting or due to biological products. There have been six known CJD cases caused by surgical or medical equipment contaminated with prions is used on another patient.\nPeople who received prion-contaminated human growth hormone prior to 1978 may also develop iatrogenic CJD. Even 50 years later, cases are still being identified.\nFinally, cases can occur in people who receive a transplant of specific materials. These include corneal (eye) grafts or dura mater (a membrane in the brain and spinal cord) grafts. If the donor had CJD that was not discovered before the donation, recipients can contract CJD."

Reptiles and amphibians require special care and are more likely than other pets to carry germs that make people sick, likeSalmonella, even when they appear clean and healthy.\nWash your handswith soap and running water:\nUse hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available. Supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol.\nChildren younger than 5 years old should not handle or touch reptiles or amphibians or their environments because they are at a higher risk for serious illness and hospitalization caused bySalmonella infection.\nYou don't have to touch a reptile or amphibian to get sick from the germs they carry. Reptile food, tank water, equipment, and habitats can be contaminated withSalmonellaand other germs.\nKeep reptiles, amphibians, and their equipment out of the kitchen or anywhere that food is prepared, stored, served, or eaten.\nDon't allow reptiles or amphibians to roam freely throughout a home or living area. Supervise your pet when outside of its habitat to prevent accidents and contamination.\nUse a designated container for storing and thawing frozen food for your pet. Keep the pet food away from human food.\nWash your hands and clean the container immediately after feeding pet reptiles and amphibians.\nFrozen or live rodents used for pet food, also called feeder rodents, can carry germs that can make people sick. This can happen even if the rodent looks healthy and clean.\nFreezing feeder rodents does not kill germs. Always wash your hands after handling live or frozen rodents or touching anything they came in contact with.\nClean and disinfect all surfaces and supplies that come in contact with rodents. Rodents can contaminate surfaces where they are thawed or anything they touch. You can get sick by touching contaminated surfaces; you don't have to touch the rodents to get sick from their germs.\nKeep rodents and their supplies out of the kitchen or other areas where food is prepared, served, or consumed. Never use the kitchen sink or food preparation areas to thaw frozen rodents or to clean live rodent habitats. Do not thaw frozen rodents in the microwave.\nClean rodent supplies outside your home when possible. If you clean rodent supplies indoors, use a laundry sink or bathtub, and thoroughly clean and disinfect the area right after.\nUse frozen rodents when possible to reduce the risk of injury to your or your pet. Never feed your pets wild rodents.\nAnimal supplies such as tanks, feeders, water containers, and other pet equipment or materials should be cleaned outside the home if possible.\nNever use food preparation areas to clean reptile and amphibian habitats or equipment.\nIf you clean supplies outside, do so away from gardens or other sources of food or drinking water.\nIf cleaning outside the home isn't possible, clean supplies in a laundry sink or bathtub.\n\tIf you clean supplies in the bathtub, thoroughly clean and disinfect the area before use by others.\nPour tank water and other wastewater from reptile and amphibian habitats down the toilet instead of sinks or drains.\nNot all reptiles and amphibians have teeth, but even those who don't (like most turtles) can still have painful bites. Bites from reptiles and amphibians can be dangerous because they can spread germs and sometimes other toxic substances, depending on the type of animal. Bites and scratches can be serious injuries and sometimes can become infected.\nDon't kiss or hold reptiles or amphibians close to your face, as this might frighten them and increase your chances of being bitten.\nMake sure the animal sees you before you pick it up. If an animal is surprised, they might bite out of fear.\nFeed your reptile with tongs. Don't give them food from your hand.\nHandle your pet often so they become used to being held. If you only handle your pet to feed them, they might learn to associate a hand with food.\nWhat to do if you are bitten or scratched\nSeek medical attention, especially if:\nIf the animal becomes sick or dies after biting a person, let your veterinarian know within a few days to a week. They can determine whether the animal might have had germs that could spread to people.\nCDC does not recommend keeping venomous animals as pets or in household settings.\nVenoms are a defense that some reptiles and amphibians use to protect themselves from any potential dangers or harm in their environment. Some venomous animals, like poison dart frogs and coral snakes, can be identified by their bright colors and markings. However, some venomous animals are harder to identify. Some animals can transmit venoms through bites or through contact with their skin or saliva.\nYou should always consider the unpredictable nature of venomous animals and be aware that treating a bite from a venomous animal is difficult. Venoms are very toxic and can have severe and life-threatening effects. Antivenoms can treat some bites, but these medications can cost hundreds of dollars and might not be available at some hospitals. In addition, antivenom sometimes can cause allergic reactions that can be just as dangerous as the venom itself.\nIf you keep or work with venomous animals, make a list of all the hospitals in your area that stock antivenoms for those types of animals. Include hospital phone numbers and addresses. Put this list somewhere easy to find, like on your refrigerator or near the animal's habitat.\nCall your healthcare provider as soon as possible so that they can prepare the appropriate antivenom.\nBe as clear as possible about the type, colors, and markings of the animal. Correct identification of the animal helps healthcare providers to provide the appropriate treatment.\nDon't handle or trap the animal, because venom can be dangerous even after the animal has died.\nRemain as calm and still as possible until you can be treated by a healthcare provider.\nApplyfirst aid:"

The BMBL is not intended to be a regulatory document, although we recognize that some may use it in that way. The core principle of this document is protocol-driven risk assessment; it is not possible for a single document to identify all of the possible combinations of risks and mitigations feasible in biomedical and clinical laboratories. The BMBL should be used as a tool in the assessment and proposed mitigation steps in biomedical and clinical laboratories.\nThis edition of BMBL includes revised sections, agent summary statements, and appendices. We harmonized the recommendations included in this edition with guidance issued and regulations promulgated by other organizations and federal agencies. Wherever possible, we clarified both the language and intent of the information provided. In order to serve the needs of our community better, this edition includes new appendices on the following topics: inactivation and verification; laboratory sustainability; large-scale biosafety; and clinical laboratory biosafety.\nOver 200 of our scientific and professional colleagues contributed to the preparation of the sixth edition through participation in technical working groups and serving as reviewers, guest editors, and subject matter experts. We wish to thank them all for their dedication and hard work. Without them, the sixth edition of BMBL would not be possible. We also recognize the hard work and contributions made by all who participated in preparation of the previous editions of BMBL; we have built on their solid work and commitment.\nIt would have been impossible to publish this revision without recognizing the visionary leadership of the previous BMBL editors\u2014Drs. John Richardson, W. Emmett Barkley, Jonathan Richmond, Robert W. McKinney, Casey Chosewood, and Deborah Wilson\u2014without whom the BMBL would not be the respected resource it is today. The Steering Committee members, Drs. Christy Myrick, Richard G. Baumann, Margy Lambert, Patricia Delarosa, and Theresa Lawrence, were instrumental in identifying authors, selecting additions to this edition, and reviewing submissions. Their significant contribution to this edition is sincerely appreciated. Dr. Robbin Weyant contributed significantly to the final editing and production efforts.\nWe are truly grateful to Ms. Shaina Mangino and Dr. Mallory Pomales of Eagle Medical Services, LLC for their expertise and patience in assisting us with this undertaking. Their superb organizational and editing skills were critical in the creation of this document.\nWe hope you find the sixth edition ofBiosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratoriescomplete, timely, and most of all, easy to use.

Not all babies will be affected by alcohol during pregnancy. However, it is impossible to know which babies will be affected.\nThere is no safe time for alcohol use during pregnancy. Alcohol can cause problems for the baby throughout pregnancy, including before a woman knows she is pregnant. Alcohol use in the first 3 months of pregnancy can cause the baby to have abnormal facial features. Growth and central nervous system problems (for example, low birthweight, behavioral problems) can occur from alcohol use anytime during pregnancy.

Some cases have developed symptoms months or years after exposure. The disease can affect one body system or affect the entire body. Because of these factors, melioidosis is hard to diagnose and may be mistaken for other diseases.\nSometimes the illness is just in one area (localized), and it may look like an ulcer or skin sore. You might have a fever, swelling, and muscle aches.\nMost often, melioidosis shows up as a lung infection. You might have a cough, chest pain, high fever, headache, and you might not feel like eating.\nWhether you've just come down with melioidosis or you've had it for a long time, it can affect different organ systems throughout the body (disseminated infection). It can cause problems with the liver, spleen, prostate, joints, bones, lymph nodes, skin, or brain. Melioidosis can lead to a dangerous bloodstream infection (sepsis).\nSymptoms of disseminated infection include:"

CDC and other federal agencies prepare for many of biological attacks to protect as many people as possible.\nCDC works with state, tribal, local, and territorial agencies to investigatepotential cases of melioidosis. Among other cases, in 2021, CDC linked four cases of melioidosis in patients from Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas. A public health investigation eventually linked all cases to a commercially imported product from a melioidosis-endemic country that each of the patients used in their homes.\nB. pseudomalleiwas recently found to occur naturally in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. CDC is working with health departments to learn more about how widespread the bacteria is and what impact it's having on health."
